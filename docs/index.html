		<h2>Yelp Reviews</h2>
		<p> A review is made when a user reviews a business, a business referring to a restaurant and other service places.</p>

		<p>For this project, the focus was restaurants in Toronto as Toronto is a big city with more than a sufficient amount
			of data to perform a serious analysis, but
			small enough for various graph algorithms to be carried out. The reviews and users considered in this project were
			those pertraining to a restaurant in Toronto.</p>

		<h3>Aim of the Analysis</h3>
		The purpose of this analysis is to investigate the properties of Yelp’s Elite users. For this analysis, the focus
		will
		lie on Yelp’s two primary claims about their Elite users:

		<ul>
			<li>Yelp states that its Elite users have high connectivity, which means that they are connected with many other
				users
				and interact often with members of their Yelp community.</li>
			<li>Yelp claims that its Elite users make up the “true heart of the Yelp community.” Third, Yelp claims that its
				users
				have a high contribution, which means that the user has made a large impact on the site with meaningful and
				high-quality reviews.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Data Story and the Dataset Used</h2>
		<p>The dataset is part of the <a href="https://www.yelp.com/dataset/challenge">YELP dataset challenge 2018</a>
			and contains YELP review data from the period 2004 to 2018, where the majority of the reviews are made in North
			America.</p>

		<h3>Quick Stats for the Toronto Dataset</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Period: March 1st, 2008 to August 1st, 2018</li>
			<li>Reviews: ~380,000</li>
			<li>Users: ~95,000</li>
			<li>Elite users hereof: ~7500</li>
			<li>Restaurants: ~10,000</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Prior Work</h2>
		<p>Our analysis involves several standard network analysis algorithms. One is the PageRank algorithm first proposed
			by Brin and Page in “The anatomy of a large-scale hypertextual Web search engine” (1998) [3] This algorithm was
			originally intended to measure the importance of web pages in web search, but we utilize it to measure the
			importance of nodes in our network. Another algorithm that we use is the Clauset-Newman-Moore community detection
			algorithm proposed by Clauset et al. in “Finding community structure in very large networks” (2004) [4]. We utilize
			this algorithm for finding communities within our networks so as to see how well certain nodes are connected to
			various communities. Our project also utilizes an algorithm for finding betweenness centrality proposed by Brandes
			in “A Faster Algorithm for Betweenness Centrality” (2001) [5]. We use this algorithm to determine how “central” a
			node is in our network structures.

		<h2>Review Network Analysis</h2>

		<h3>Review Distributions - Elite vs. Non-elite</h3>
		Are Elite users more critical in their ratings, compared to regular users?

		<h3>Centrality Measures for the Social Network</h3>

				<tr>
				  <th>Measure</th>
				  <th>Elite Users Avg</th>
				  <th>Regular Users Avg</th>
				  <th>All Users Avg</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				  <td>Degree Centrality</td>
				  <td>1.40E-04</td>
				  <td>2.05E-06</td>
				  <td>2.67E-06</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				  <td>Page Rank</td>
				  <td>2.40E-03</td>

		<p style='text-align: justify;'>
			The main part of this project involves analyzing Elite users on Yelp’s social network. The resulting social graph is
			undirected and rather large, with 95,000 nodes and 380,000 edges. The size of the network means some of our
			algorithms take an unreasonable amount of time to run, however, we did it anyway!

			The experiment conducted where a 1, 2, 3... Percent of elite users were deleted from the network and where the size
			of the largest connected component, i.e. the number of nodes was noted down for each iteration. Deleting all elite
			users ends up in deleting 35% of all connected nodes from the network, even tough elite users only make up 8 percent
			of the total amount of nodes. Hence, the size of the largest CC drops more than twice as quickly when removing Elite
			as when removing non-Elite nodes. This tells us that the elite users are the ‘glue’ of the network, for a lack of a
			better word.
