		<h2>Data Story and the Dataset Used</h2>
		The dataset is part of the <a href="https://www.yelp.com/dataset/challenge">YELP dataset challenge 2018</a>
		and contains YELP review data from the period 2004 to 2018. The vast majority of reviews are in North America,
		and for this analysis, Toronto, Canada, was the city of choice, in order to shrink down the dataset to a managable
		size.

		<h3>Aim of the Analysis</h3>
		The purpose of this analysis is to investigate the properties of Yelp’s Elite users. For this paper, the focus will
		lie on Yelp’s two primary claims about their Elite users:

		<ul>
			<li>Yelp states that its Elite users have high connectivity, which means that they are connected with many other
				users
				and interact often with members of their Yelp community.</li>
			<li>Yelp claims that its Elite users make up the “true heart of the Yelp community.” Third, Yelp claims that its
				users
				have a high contribution, which means that the user has made a large impact on the site with meaningful and
				high-quality reviews.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Quick Stats for the Toronto Dataset</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Period: March 1st, 2008 to August 1st, 2018</li>
			<li>Reviews: ~380,000</li>
			<li>Users: ~95,000</li>
			<li>Elite users hereof: ~7500</li>
			<li>Restaurants: ~10,000</li>
		</ul>

			The main part of this project involves analyzing Elite users on Yelp’s social network. The resulting social graph is
			undirected and rather large, with 95,000 nodes and 380,000 edges. The size of the network means some of our
			algorithms take an unreasonable amount of time to run, however, we did it anyway!

			The experiment conducted where a 1, 2, 3... Percent of elite users were deleted from the network and where the size
			of the largest connected component, i.e. the number of nodes was noted down for each iteration. Deleting all elite
			users ends up in deleting 35% of all connected nodes from the network, even tough elite users only make up 8 percent
			of the total amount of nodes. Hence, the size of the largest CC drops more than twice as quickly when removing Elite
			as when removing non-Elite nodes. This tells us that the elite users are the ‘glue’ of the network, for a lack of a
			better word.
