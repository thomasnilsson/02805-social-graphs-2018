'''Patrick Joseph "Pat" Tiberi''' (born October 21, 1962) is the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|Ohio|12}}, serving since 2001. He is a member of the [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]]. He previously served in the [[Ohio House of Representatives]].

The district includes many [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]] suburbs north and east of the City.

==Early life, education and career==
The son of Italian immigrants, Tiberi was born in Columbus and attended the city's Woodward Park Middle school, then [[Northland High School (Columbus, Ohio)|Northland High School]]. Tiberi attended [[Ohio State University|The Ohio State University]] where he was a member of [[The Ohio State University Marching Band]]. He graduated from The Ohio State University in 1985 with a degree in journalism and was the first in his family to graduate from college.<ref>http://tiberi.house.gov/biography/</ref> He was later awarded an [[honorary doctorate]] in the [[Humanities]] by [[Capital University]] in May, 2005.

Upon graduation from college, Tiberi worked as a realtor for RE/MAX Achievers, a franchise of [[RE/MAX]], located in Lewis Center, Ohio. He was elected to the [[Ohio House of Representatives]] in 1993, and he soon rose to the position of House Majority Leader.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
Tiberi has authored legislation that made it easier for returning military veterans to receive federal jobs and provided for more federal assistance to caregivers of incapacitated adults. Both of the bills were passed in 2006.

Tiberi voted against the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]], saying the bill was "loaded with [[Nancy Pelosi]]'s grab bag of big spending wishes." Following passage of the bill, Tiberi wrote a letter to United States Secretary of Agriculture [[Tom Vilsack]] in an effort to bring stimulus money to his district.<ref>{{cite news|last=Koff|first=Stephen|title=Ohio congressman blasted stimulus, but now wants a piece of the pie|url=http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2010/02/ohio_congressman_blasted_stimu.html|newspaper=The Plain Dealer|date=February 9, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=McElhatton|first=Jim|title=Stimulus foes see value in seeking cash|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/feb/09/stimulus-foes-see-value-in-seeking-cash/|newspaper=The Washington Times|date=February 9, 2010}}</ref>

=== Policy Positions===

====Older Americans====
Then-chairman of the Select Education Subcommittee, Pat Tiberi wrote the bill that reauthorized the Older Americans Act through fiscal year 2011. This bill provides most of the funding for social services and nutritional programs for the nation’s seniors.<ref>[http://tiberi.house.gov/issues/issue/?IssueID=3791]</ref> Pat Tiberi received an 86 from the Retire Safe-Positions and a 10 from Alliance for Retired Americans-Lifetime Score.<ref name="votesmart.org">[http://votesmart.org/candidate/evaluations/8404/pat-tiberi#.UKx0I47EWAG]</ref> Congressman Tiberi has introduced other legislation to improve care for older Americans including writing and sponsoring The Older Americans Act Amendments of 2006.

====Education Reform====
Pat Tiberi supports reform to the No Child Left Behind bill.

(Retrieved August 26, 2013)</ref> The Order of Merit of the Italian Republic (Italian: Ordine al merito della Repubblica Italiana) was founded as the senior order of knighthood by the second President of the Italian Republic, Luigi Einaudi in 1951.<ref>[[Order of Merit of the Italian Republic]] ([http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Order_of_Merit_of_the_Italian_Republic&oldid=569105879 this version])</ref>

=== Workforce ===
In 2014, Tiberi cosponsored legislation called the [[Save American Workers Act of 2013]] that would make a 40 hours, instead of 30, the standard definition of [[Full-time and part-time work|full-time]] work.<ref>Martin, Aaron.

Retrieved January 31, 2014.</ref>

=== Tax policy ===
On April 10, 2014, Tiberi introduced the [[America's Small Business Tax Relief Act of 2014 (H.R. 4457; 113th Congress)]], a bill that would amend section 179 of the [[Internal Revenue Code]], which mostly affects small- to medium-sized businesses, to retroactively and permanently extend from January 1, 2014, increased the cap on the amount of investment that can be immediately deducted from [[taxable income]].<ref name=cbo4457>{{cite web|title=CBO - H.R. 4457|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/45326|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=12 June 2014}}</ref> The bill would return the tax code to its 2013 status and make the change permanent.<ref name=PomerleauTaxFound>{{cite web|last1=Pomerleau|first1=Kyle|title=Tiberi Bill on permanent Extension of Small Business Expensing|url=http://taxfoundation.org/blog/tiberi-bill-permanent-extension-small-business-expensing|publisher=Tax Foundation|accessdate=12 June 2014|date=22 April 2014}}</ref>

==Political campaigns==
In 2000, Tiberi ran for and won the House seat that was vacated by nine-term incumbent and Chairman of the House Budget Committee [[John Kasich]], who retired to work as a consultant for Lehman Brothers.  He only won by nine points in a district that had long been considered to be far friendlier to the Democrats than the neighboring 15th, despite Kasich's long tenure.  However, Tiberi hasn't faced a close race since, in part because his district was redrawn after the 2000 census. In 2006, Tiberi won reelection after defeating former Democratic Congressman [[Bob Shamansky]].

===2008===

==Recent events==
Congressman Tiberi recently spoke at a [[Ripon Society]] forum and addressed the [[2013 IRS scandal]] and tax reform. Tiberi declared the IRS is one of the worst scandals he has seen in [[History of the United States|American history]], stating that "...it’s not like any other. It has Democrats, non-political independents, business owners, other individuals and people who don’t pay attention to government, kind of on their toes, because they know it can happen to them." The Congressman went on to say that the only way out was to show bipartisan partnership among the Administration in order to "...get this scandal off the front page [and] working with Republicans to get comprehensive tax reform done in a way that simplifies our code."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.riponsociety.org/news_5-21-13.htm |title=This is something that sends chills down regular Americans’ spines |date=May 21, 2013|publisher=The Ripon Society |accessdate=10 June 2013}}</ref>
