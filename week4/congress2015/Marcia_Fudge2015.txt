==2014 Midterm election comments==
During a presentation at the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation 44th Annual Legislative Conference in September 2014 Rep. Fudge commented on the need for black voters to get out an "vote".  Rep. Fudge said, "If we don't vote, believe it or not they are going to file articles of impeachment against our President.  If we don't vote, the street in front of your house is not going to get fixed.  If we don't vote, we're going to have hungry children across this country".<ref>http://dailysurge.com/2014/09/dem-rep-fudge-blacks-dont-vote-kids-will-go-hungry/</ref> Rep. Fudge continued to use fear as a tool to mobilize voters by saying; "Once they know what is at stake, they will vote," Fudge promised, adding that her  Caucus will tell black voters that Republicans will try to change entitlement programs, reduce funds for schools and emergency services, raise the Social Security retirement age, remove money from Medicaid or Medicare and "make our lives miserable for the next two years" if their power in Congress increases. <ref>http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2014/09/rep_marcia_fudge_announces_con.html</ref>

She also predicted GOP members of Congress would "try to make our president an illegitimate president" with claims that he isn't born in the United States, wasn't smart enough to go to Harvard, and ignores the laws. <ref>http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2014/09/rep_marcia_fudge_announces_con.html</ref>

"We will have two more years of that foolishness if they take back the Senate and get a few more seats in the House," said Fudge, a Warrensville Heights Democrat, who predicted voters "will be standing in the line waiting for the doors to open" at the polls when they hear what members of her group have to say. <ref>http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2014/09/rep_marcia_fudge_announces_con.html</ref>

Rep. Fudge, during the Congressional Black Caucus town hall meeting chastised voters for complaining and reminded them the Congressional Black Caucus was doing fighting for them.  Rep. Fudge commented; "The black caucus fights for you every day. Even when you won’t fight for yourself. We fight for you. Whether it’s immigration or education, whether it’s food stamps or housing, we fight for you every day. So my message to you is to contain your complaining." <ref>http://downtrend.com/robertgehl/dem-black-congresswoman-to-black-democrats-we-give-you-food-stamps-so-quit-your-bitching/</ref>
