{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Texas, 2012#District 27}}
[[Redistricting]] after the 2010 census made Farenthold's district significantly more Republican. His old district had been 70 percent Latino, but the new map shifted most of the Latino areas to the newly created 34th district.  To make up for the loss in population, his district was shifted well to the north and east, absorbing some heavily Republican territory near [[Houston, Texas|Houston]] and [[Austin, Texas|Austin]].

He defeated Democratic nominee Rose Meza Harrison 57%-39%.<ref>http://elections.sos.state.tx.us/elchist.exe</ref>

;2014

Farenthold was not challenged in the Republican primary. In the general election, he defeated Democrat Wesley Reed.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Hendricks|first1=Dave|title=Farenthold retains congressional seat|url=http://www.caller.com/news/politics/national/farenthold-takes-commanding-lead-in-early-voting_26305095|accessdate=17 December 2014|work=Corpus Christie Caller Times|date=4 November 2014}}</ref>

===Tenure===
Farenthold has joined the [[Republican Study Committee]], as well as the [[Tea Party Caucus]]. Since redistricting in 2011, his district runs along the middle Texas gulf coast from [[Corpus Christi, Texas|Corpus Christi]] to [[Bay City, Texas|Bay City]] and inland to [[Luling, Texas|Luling]], and includes [[Aransas County, Texas|Aransas]], [[Calhoun County, Texas|Calhoun]], [[Jackson County, Texas|Jackson]], [[Lavaca County, Texas|Lavaca]], [[Matagorda County, Texas|Matagorda]], [[Nueces County, Texas|Nueces]], [[Refugio County, Texas|Refugio]], [[San Patricio County, Texas|San Patricio]], [[Victoria County, Texas|Victoria]], [[Wharton County, Texas|Wharton]], and parts of [[Bastrop County, Texas|Bastrop]], [[Caldwell County, Texas|Caldwell]], and [[Gonzales County, Texas|Gonzales]] counties.

In December 2014, Farenthold was sued by a former staffer, who accused the congressman of gender discrimination, saying that he created a hostile work environment and improperly fired her after she complained.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Bresnahan|first1=John|title=Ex-spokeswoman sues Blake Farenthold, alleges discrimination|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2014/12/blake-farenthold-lawsuit-discrimination-113620.html|accessdate=17 December 2014|work=Politico|date=16 December 2014}}</ref>

In 1972, when Farenthold was ten years old, his father disappeared and was later found dead, his body having washed ashore after being weighed down with a cement block and deposited in [[Corpus Christi Bay]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Millionaire slain; Found on beach|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1314&dat=19720607&id=e-0vAAAAIBAJ&sjid=j-wDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3954,2965899|accessdate=20 October 2013|newspaper=The Spokesman-Review|date=7 June 1972|agency=Associated Press|location=Spokane, WA}}</ref> The gangland-style murder was the work of enemies of the elder Farenthold, who feared he would testify against a group of con artists who had tried to defraud him out of $100,000.<ref>{{cite news|last=Draper|first=Robert|title=The Blood of the Farentholds|url=http://www.texasmonthly.com/content/blood-farentholds/page/0/3|accessdate=20 October 2013|newspaper=Texas Monthly|date=April 1992}}</ref>

===Controversy over pajama images===

In 2010, images of Farenthold dressed in duck pajamas alongside women in lingerie emerged on the website thecrushgirls.com. Farenthold's Democratic challenger subsequently ran a political ad highlighting the unusual subject nature of the matter.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Siegel|first1=Elyse|title=GOP Candidate Blake Farenthold Targeted After Being Caught in Ducky Pajamas With Scantily Clad Women|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/10/16/blake-farenthold-pictures_n_764685.html|accessdate=8 December 2014|work=The Huffington Post|date=16 October 2010}}</ref>
