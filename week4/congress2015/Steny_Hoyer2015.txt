==Early political career==
For four years, from 1962 to 1966, Hoyer was a member of the staff of United States Senator [[Daniel Brewster]] (D-[[Maryland]]); also on Senator Brewster's staff at that time was [[Nancy Pelosi]], who would later become a leadership colleague of Hoyer as she served as Minority Leader and Speaker of the House.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/15/AR2006111501521.html|title=Pelosi Splits Democrats With Push For Murtha|author=Jonathan Weisman and Lois Romano|publisher=Washington Post|date=November 16, 2006|accessdate=2006-11-16}}</ref>

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
Fifth District Congresswoman [[Gladys Spellman]] fell into a [[coma]] three days before the 1980 election. She was reelected, but it soon became apparent that she would never regain consciousness, and Congress declared her seat vacant by resolution in February 1981. Hoyer narrowly won a crowded seven-way Democratic [[primary election|primary]], beating Spellman's husband Reuben by only 1,600 votes. He then defeated a better funded [[U.S. Republican Party|Republican]], Audrey Scott, in the May 19 [[special election]] by 56%-44%, earning himself the nickname of "boy wonder".<ref name="washingtonpost.com">Shailagh Murray [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/16/AR2006111601524.html "Political Pragmatism Carried Hoyer to the Top"].

;Fundraising
Hoyer is a prolific fundraiser for House Democrats. He has been the top giver to fellow party members in the House. In the 2008 election cycle, he contributed more than $1 million to the party and individual candidates as of July 14, 2008.<ref>

In March 2007, the [[Center for Public Integrity]] reported that Hoyer's political action committee "raised nearly $1 million for congressional candidates [in the 2006 election cycle] by exploiting what experts call a legal loophole." The Center reported the following:
<blockquote>Campaign finance disclosure records show that the Maryland Democrat used his leadership political action committee — AmeriPAC — as a conduit to collect bundles of checks from individuals, and from business and union interests. He then passed more than $960,000 along to 53 House candidates and another quarter of a million to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, data compiled from the Center for Responsive Politics Web site show.

Federal law generally prohibits political action committees, including leadership PACs, which are run by politicians, from receiving more than $5,000 each year from a single donor or giving more than $10,000 to a single candidate ($5,000 each for the primary and the general election). But Hoyer collected as much as $136,000 from one labor union committee and distributed more than $86,000 to a single Congressional race.<ref>

The only media to cover the report, the [[Capital News Service (Maryland)|Capital News Service]], quickly pointed out how common and legal the practice is:
<blockquote>"That's like saying somebody who deducts mortgage interest on their taxes is exploiting a tax loophole," said Nathaniel Persily, a campaign finance expert and University of Pennsylvania Law School professor. "What exactly is the problem?"

"Bundling is very common," said Steve Weisman, of the George Washington University's Campaign Finance Institute.

What Hoyer, a lawyer, did was perfectly legal, the Federal Election Commission said, too. In fact, his insistence on detailed reporting made tracking the funds easier.<ref>

===Party leadership===
[[Image:Steny Hoyer, official photo portrait, circa 1980s.jpg|left|thumb|An earlier congressional portrait of Hoyer.]]
Fifth District Congresswoman [[Gladys Spellman]] fell into a [[coma]] three days before the 1980 election.  She was reelected, but it soon became apparent that she would never regain consciousness, and Congress declared her seat vacant by resolution in February 1981. Hoyer narrowly won a crowded seven-way Democratic [[primary election|primary]], beating Spellman's husband Reuben by only 1,600 votes.  He then defeated a better funded [[U.S. Republican Party|Republican]] candidate in the May 19 [[special election]], earning himself the nickname of "boy wonder".<ref name="washingtonpost.com"/>  He won the seat for a full term in 1982 and has been reelected 14 times with no substantive opposition, and is the longest-serving House member from southern Maryland ever.<ref name="Hoyer official bio" />

Hoyer has served as chair of the [[Democratic Caucus of the United States House of Representatives|Democratic Caucus]], the fourth-ranking position among [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] Democrats, from 1989 to 1994; the former co-chair (and a current member) of the Democratic Steering Committee; and as the chief candidate recruiter for House Democrats from 1995 to 2000. He also served as Deputy Majority [[Whip (politics)|Whip]] from 1987 to 1989.<ref name="MD Archives" />

When [[David E. Bonior]] resigned as Minority Whip in early 2002, Hoyer ran but lost to [[Nancy Pelosi]]. After the 2002 midterm elections, Pelosi ran to succeed [[Dick Gephardt]] as Minority Leader, leaving the Minority Whip post open again.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://politics.blogs.foxnews.com/2010/11/05/hoyer-has-won-contested-leadership-races | work=Fox News | title=Hoyer has won contested leadership races before - FoxNews.com | date=November 5, 2010}}</ref> On November 14, 2002, Hoyer was unanimously elected by his colleagues in the Democratic Caucus to serve as the Minority Whip, the second-highest-ranking position among House Democrats.<ref name="Hoyer official bio" />

Pelosi became the [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] in January 2007. Hoyer was elected by his colleagues to be House Majority Leader for the 110th Congress, defeating [[John Murtha]] of [[Pennsylvania]] by a vote of 149-86 within the [[House Democratic Caucus|caucus]], despite Pelosi endorsing Murtha.<ref name="reuters20061116"/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/11/08/congress.new.leader/

The day after the 2010 midterms elections in which the Democrats lost control of the House, Hoyer had a private conversation with Pelosi and stated that he would not challenge her bid for Minority Leader (for Pelosi to remain Democratic House Leader).<ref>[http://www.politicsdaily.com/2010/11/03/nancy-pelosi-has-no-regrets-following-midterm-rout/ Nancy Pelosi Has 'No Regrets' Following Midterm Rout<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> He ran for minority whip, but was challenged by outgoing Majority Whip [[Jim Clyburn]] (the top House Democrats want to remain in the leadership, but the minority party in the House has one less position). Hoyer is moderate while Pelosi and Clyburn are more liberal, and a significant number of Hoyer's would-be supporters in the House who were moderate and conservative Democrats had been defeated for re-election.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/onpolitics/post/2010/11/steny-hoyer-james-clyburn-democratic-leadership-/1 | work=USA Today | first=Catalina | last=Camia | title=Democrats Hoyer, Clyburn fight for leadership post | date=November 8, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/postpartisan/2010/11/hire_hoyer.html | work=The Washington Post | title=Hire Hoyer}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2010/11/08/hoyer-clyburn-an-impromptu-leadership-fight/ | work=The Wall Street Journal | first=Patrick | last=O'Connor | title=Hoyer, Clyburn: An Impromptu Leadership Fight | date=November 8, 2010}}</ref> The [[Congressional Black Caucus]] backed Clyburn, while 30 House Democrats have supported Hoyer, and Hoyer has also raised money and campaigned for many candidates.<ref>[http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2010/11/high-profile-dems-back-hoyer-in-whip-race.php High Profile Dems Back Hoyer In Whip Race | TPMDC<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/darcy-burner/the-progressive-case-for_b_779979.html | work=Huffington Post | first=Darcy | last=Burner | title=The Progressive Case for Steny Hoyer as Minority Whip | date=May 25, 2011}}</ref> Hoyer received further support from outgoing Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman [[Howard L.
