{{See also|United States Senate election in Pennsylvania, 2000}}
In [[United States Senate election in Pennsylvania, 2000|2000]], she decided to challenge [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] U.S. Senator [[Rick Santorum]]. [[Pittsburgh]]-area U.S. Congressman [[Ron Klink]] won the crowded, six-candidate Democratic primary with a plurality of 41% of the vote. Schwartz ranked second with 27% of the vote, dominating the southeastern part of the state, most notably Philadelphia (60%) and Montgomery (62%) counties. She also won two counties outside of the region: Centre (33%) and Union (38%). However, this was not enough to overcome Klink's dominance in the western part of the state.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=127072</ref>

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
;2004
In 2003, Democratic U.S. Congressman [[Joe Hoeffel]], of [[Pennsylvania's 13th congressional district]], decided not to run for a fourth term, in order to challenge Republican U.S. Senator [[Arlen Specter]]. Schwartz had originally planned to run for [[Auditor General of Pennsylvania|Auditor General]], but changed her plans after Hoeffel's announcement. In early 2004, she moved from Philadelphia to [[Jenkintown, Pennsylvania|Jenkintown]] in Montgomery County, where she still lives today. She won the Democratic primary, narrowly defeating former [[Philadelphia]] deputy mayor and [[National Constitution Center]] director [[Joe Torsella]] 52%-48%. She won 62% of Montgomery while Torsella won 57% of Philadelphia.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=5104</ref> While most former state legislators raise comparatively more money through [[Political action committee|PACs]] than individual donations, she raised $4,597,032<ref>[http://www.opensecrets.org/states/election.asp?State=PA&year=2004 Pennsylvania Congressional Races in 2008<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> from individual donations and comparatively little ($558,376) in PAC donations. The 13th had long been reckoned as a classic moderate southeastern Republican district, but had become increasingly Democratic in recent years. A Republican presidential candidate hasn't carried it since 1988, and it has been in Democratic hands for all but four years since 1993. In the general election, she defeated Republican Melissa Brown 56%-41%, winning both counties.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=4327</ref>
