In the 1992 November general election, Goodlatte defeated Democratic candidate Stephen Musselwhite, who had defeated Olin's preferred choice at the district Democratic convention, with 60% of the vote. Goodlatte has been reelected ten times, often running unopposed. His most substantive opposition was in 1996, with Democratic candidate Jeff Grey, and again in 1998, with Democratic [[Roanoke, VA|Roanoke]] mayor [[David A. Bowers|David Bowers]] who challenged him. In an overwhelmingly conservative district, Goodlatte turned back these challenges, with 67% and 69% of the vote, respectively.

===Policy===

====Immigration Reform====
As House Judiciary Chairman for the 113th congress, Goodlatte has contrasted the House approach to immigration reform from the Senate by requiring that the various issues be taken on a piece-by-piece basis with an emphasis on both border and interior enforcement measures. So far the House Judiciary Committee has passed four immigration related bills:<ref>[http://judiciary.house.gov/hearings/markups113.html ]{{dead link|date=August 2014}}</ref>
* H.R. 2278, the "Strengthen and Fortify Enforcement Act" (The SAFE Act)<ref>[http://judiciary.house.gov/hearings/Markups%202013/mark_06182013.html ]{{dead link|date=August 2014}}</ref>
* H.R. 1773, the "Agricultural Guestworker Act"<ref>[http://judiciary.house.gov/hearings/Markups%202013/mark_06192013.html ]{{dead link|date=August 2014}}</ref>
* H.R. 1772, the "Legal Workforce Act"<ref name="judiciary.house.gov">[http://judiciary.house.gov/hearings/Markups%202013/mark_06262013.html ]{{dead link|date=August 2014}}</ref>
* H.R. 2131, the "SKILLS Visa Act"<ref name="judiciary.house.gov"/>

====Balanced Budget Amendment====
One of Representative Goodlatte's top legislative initiatives was his Constitutional amendment to require a balanced federal budget. Goodlatte wrote and put forward both the "clean" Balanced Budget Amendment which had a higher chance of actually passing the House and the Senate as well as a version that makes it harder to increase taxes by requiring a two-thirds majority vote in both chambers to raise taxes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atr.org/conservatives-congress-vote-weak-balanced-budget-a6580|title=Conservatives to Congress: Vote NO on a Weak Balanced Budget Amendment|author=Mattie Duppler|date=2011-11-09|accessdate=2012-06-03|publisher=Americans for Tax Reform}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/on-the-money/budget/192699-gop-favors-clean-balanced-budget-amendment-sponsor-says |title=Sponsor says 'clean' balanced budget amendment has edge for floor vote |publisher=TheHill |date=2014-06-23 |accessdate=2014-08-08}}</ref> However, Representatives [[Paul Ryan]], [[Justin Amash]], [[David Dreier]] and [[Louie Gohmert]] voted against the "clean" amendment because it could have allowed taxes to be raised on Americans. Representative Ryan released a statement after the vote: [http://campaign2012.washingtonexaminer.com/blogs/beltway-confidential/why-ryan-voted-against-balanced-budget-amendment "I’m concerned that this version will lead to a much bigger government fueled by more taxes. Spending is the problem, yet this version of the Balanced Budget Amendment makes it more likely taxes will be raised, government will grow, and economic freedom will be diminished. Without a limit on government spending, I cannot support this Amendment.”]

Bob Goodlatte voted to increase the U.S. debt ceiling seven times and has voted to pass budgets from Democratic as well as Republican administrations. He voted for Bill Clinton's Budget Act in July, 1997 and Barack Obama's Budget Act of 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/112-2011/h690 |title=Budget Control Act of 2011 |date=August 1, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/105-1997/h345 |title=H.R. 2015 |date=July 24, 1997}}</ref>

SOPA's critics charge that copyright owners are able to seek immediate recourse for copyrights violations through the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] as well as [[Title 17 of the United States Code]]. Technology engineers, website owners and venture capitalists charge that the bill will hurt Internet architecture, decrease tech industry job growth and unnecessarily burden and increase the costs of doing business for domestic website owners and operators. Free Speech advocates and conservatives charge that the bill centralizes authority at the executive branch, which might use it to prevent search engines and [[Internet Services Provider]]s from delivering dissenting websites to customers; violates the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]; establishes Internet firewalls; and hinders online users from sharing information.<ref>{{cite speech|url=http://americanrhetoric.com/speeches/katherineoyamahorjudiciarycomtestmt.htm|first=Katherine|last=Oyama|date=2011-11-16|accessdate=2012-06-03|title=Opening Statement to the HOR Judiciary Committee Hearing on H.R. 3261, the Stop Online Piracy Act|publisher=American Rhetoric}}</ref>

The Act was passed at midnight the day Congress adjourned before the [[United States general elections, 2006|2006 elections]]. Prior to it being added to the [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]], the gambling provisions had not been debated by any [[United States Congressional committee|Congressional committee]].<ref>[http://www.gamblingandthelaw.com/columns/2006_act.htm Nelson Rose: The Unlawful Internet gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 Analyzed]</ref> The bill was made sure to exclude online gambling. They claimed moral reasons for pushing for a ban on Internet gambling, but critics charge that it was due to campaign contributions from Microsoft and Steam .<ref>[http://www.casinogamblingweb.com/gambling-news/gambling-law/inside_the_goodlatte_conspiracy_the_good_fund_the_uigea_47855.html Inside the Goodlatte Conspiracy]</ref>

Goodlatte sat on the [[105th Congress|105th United States Congress]] and introduced [[NET Act]] on July 25, 1997, which removed the requirement of financial gain for criminal prosecution of [[copyright infringement]].<ref>{{USbill|105|hr|2265}}</ref>  NET Act was passed only after the House suspended the rules.<ref>[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d105:HR02265:@@@Z Bill Summary & Status 105th Congress (1997 - 1998) H.R.2265]</ref>

===Legislation===
On September 12, 2013, Goodlatte introduced the [[Permanent Internet Tax Freedom Act (H.R. 3086; 113th Congress)]], a bill that would amend the [[Internet Tax Freedom Act]] to make permanent the ban on state and local taxation of Internet access and on multiple or discriminatory taxes on [[electronic commerce]].<ref name=3086sum>{{cite web|title=H.R. 3086 - Summary|url=https://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/3086|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=15 July 2014}}</ref> Goodlatte wrote an op-ed in ''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]'' arguing strongly in favor of the bill. Goodlatte said that in "our new digital economy" a "computer and internet access serve as a gateway - if not a necessity - for the American Dream. Millions of Americans now rely on the internet to run their businesses, to educate themselves, to seek new opportunities, to research and write, and to communicate with family and friends."<ref name=GoodlatteHill>{{cite news|last1=Goodlatte|first1=Bob|title=Make Internet access tax ban permanent|url=http://thehill.com/opinion/op-ed/212228-make-internet-access-tax-ban-permanent|accessdate=16 July 2014|publisher=The Hill|date=15 July 2014}}</ref> According to Goodlatte, the bill was necessary to protect the American people and their ability to access the internet from the high monetary barriers that would be created if states were allowed to tax internet access.<ref name="GoodlatteHill"/>
