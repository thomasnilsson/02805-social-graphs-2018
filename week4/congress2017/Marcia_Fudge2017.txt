[[File:Rep Marcia Fudge 02 - Akron Ohio - 2016-10-03 (29986764852).jpg|thumb|Fudge speaking at a rally for [[Hillary Clinton]], October 2016]]
During a presentation at the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation's 44th Annual Legislative Conference in September, 2014, Rep. Fudge commented on the indispensability of black voters.  Rep. Fudge said, "If we don't vote, believe it or not they are going to file articles of impeachment against our President.  If we don't vote, the street in front of your house is not going to get fixed.  If we don't vote, we're going to have hungry children across this country".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dailysurge.com/2014/09/dem-rep-fudge-blacks-dont-vote-kids-will-go-hungry/|title=Dem Rep: If Blacks Don't Vote, Kids Will Go Hungry » DailySurge|work=DailySurge|accessdate=August 19, 2015}}</ref>

She also predicted GOP members of Congress would "try to make our president an illegitimate president" with claims that he wasn't born in the United States, wasn't smart enough to attend Harvard, and ignores the laws.<ref name="cleveland.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2014/09/rep_marcia_fudge_announces_con.html|title=Rep.

"We will have two more years of that foolishness if they take back the Senate and get a few more seats in the House," said Fudge, a Warrensville Heights Democrat, who predicted voters "will be standing in the line waiting for the doors to open" at the polls when they hear what members of her group have to say.<ref name="cleveland.com" />

Rep. Fudge, during the Congressional Black Caucus town hall meeting, chastised voters for complaining, and emphasized that the Congressional Black Caucus was fighting for them.  Rep. Fudge commented, "The black caucus fights for you every day. Even when you won’t fight for yourself. We fight for you. Whether it’s immigration or education, whether it’s food stamps or housing, we fight for you every day. So my message to you is to contain your complaining." <ref>{{cite web|url=http://downtrend.com/robertgehl/dem-black-congresswoman-to-black-democrats-we-give-you-food-stamps-so-quit-your-bitching/|title=Dem.
