==U.S. House of Representatives==

===2010===
{{Main article|United States House of Representatives elections in Missouri, 2010#District 4}}

After almost a decade out of politics, Hartzler entered the Republican primary for {{ushr|MO|4}}, which at the time was held by 17-term Democratic incumbent [[Ike Skelton]]. She won a crowded seven-way primary with 40 percent of the vote.

In the November 2, 2010 general election, Hartzler won with 50.43% of the vote. She is the first Republican to represent this district since 1955, and only the second since the [[Great Depression]]. She was also the second Republican woman elected to Congress from Missouri, after [[Jo Ann Emerson]], with whom she served from 2011 to 2013. However, she is the first who was not elected as a stand-in for her husband; Emerson was originally elected to serve out the final term of her late husband, [[Bill Emerson]].  Republicans had been making gains in the district for some time; it gave [[John McCain]] 62 percent of the vote in 2008 while simultaneously reelecting Democrat Skelton, and Republicans hold most of the district's seats in the state legislature.

She ran on a conservative platform, voicing support for tax cuts and spending cuts.  She opposes [[abortion]] and [[same-sex marriage]].
