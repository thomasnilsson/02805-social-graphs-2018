==Early life, education, and early political career==
Born and raised in West [[Philadelphia]], Wolf overcame an early [[speech impediment]] which caused him to [[stutter]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://presencetelecare.com/current-postings/presence-telecare-interviews-congressman-frank-wolf |title=Telepractice – Frank Wolf Interview |publisher=PresenceTelecare.com |date=11 November 2009 |accessdate=2014-06-26}}</ref> Attending [[Pennsylvania State University]], he was a member of [[Alpha Sigma Phi]] fraternity, received a degree in political science and subsequently earned a law degree from [[Georgetown University Law Center]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]. He then joined the [[United States Army]] as a reservist and became a lawyer for the military.

Wolf entered politics in 1968, at the age of 29, when he became a legislative assistant to [[Edward Biester]], the Republican congressman from [[Pennsylvania's 8th congressional district]]. From 1971 to 1975, Wolf served as an assistant to [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] [[Rogers Morton]].

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
[[File:1981 wolf p142.jpg|thumb|160px|left|1981, ''Congressional Pictorial Directory'', Wolf as a first term Congressman]]
During the [[United States presidential election, 1976|1976 presidential election year]], Wolf's first campaign for [[Virginia's 10th congressional district]] ended with his loss in the Republican primary to [[Vince Callahan]] by 45%–42%.<ref name="NJA"/> Two years later, amidst the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1978|1978 midterm elections]], he won the Republican nomination unopposed, but lost the general election to the incumbent [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], [[Joseph L. Fisher]], 53%–47%.<ref name="NJA">{{cite web |url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/almanac/2010/person/frank-wolf-va/ |title=Rep. Frank Wolf (R) |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |year=2011 |work=[[National Journal]] Almanac |publisher=National Journal Group Inc. |accessdate=29 January 2013}}</ref>

Along with [[Ronald Reagan]]'s decisive victory over incumbent President [[Jimmy Carter]] in the [[United States presidential election, 1980|1980 presidential election]], Wolf's third run for the House seat proved to be successful, as he won the Republican primary with 75% of the vote and then defeated Fisher in a re-election, 51%–49%.<ref name="NJA"/> In the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1982|1982 midterms]], Wolf won re-election with 53% of the vote.<ref name="NJA"/> Wolf was unopposed by a Democratic opponent in [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1994|1994]] and [[United States House of Representatives elections, 2000|2000]]. His closest races have come in the Democratic wave elections of [[United States House of Representatives elections, 2006|2006]] and [[United States House of Representatives elections, 2008|2008]]. On both occasions he defeated professor [[Judy Feder]], by 57%–41% and 59%–39%, respectively.<ref name="NJA"/><ref>{{cite web   |url=https://www.voterinfo.sbe.virginia.gov/election/DATA/2008/07261AFC-9ED3-410F-B07D-84D014AB2C6B/Official/6_s.shtml  |accessdate=2013-01-28  |publisher=[[Virginia State Board of Elections]]  |title=November 2008 Official Results}}</ref> In 2012, as Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney carried the district by 1%, Wolf was re-elected by 20%.<ref>{{cite web|last=Trifone |first=Nicole |url= http://mclean.patch.com/articles/election-results-virginia-s-10th-district |title= Frank Wolf Wins Re-Election |publisher=patch.com |date= November 7, 2012|accessdate=2014-06-26}}</ref> In September 2013, it was announced that Wolf will be challenged in the 2014 election by Democrat Richard Bolger, a Fairfax attorney and small business owner.<ref>{{cite web|last=Cahn |first=Emily |url=http://atr.rollcall.com/frank-wolf-receives-democratic-challenger-va10/ |title=Frank Wolf Receives Democratic Challenger |publisher=RollCall.com |date=6 September 2013 |accessdate= 2014-06-26}}</ref><ref>http://www.richardbolger.com</ref>

The [[Virginia's 10th congressional district|10th District]] has seen extensive changes since Wolf took office. Initially a purely [[Northern Virginia]] district covering [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax]], [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington]], and [[Loudoun County, Virginia|Loudoun]] counties, the 1990 redistricting by a Democratic [[Virginia General Assembly]] moved the district away from Arlington and enlarged to the west and south to encompass parts of the congressional district held by U.S. Rep. [[George Allen (U.S. politician)|George Allen]], which was eliminated to create a black-majority district in accordance with the Voting Rights Act. Allen chose not to challenge Wolf, instead running for [[Governor of Virginia]] in 1993. The district kept approximately the same complexion after the 2000 apportionment by a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Virginia General Assembly]], but lost territory in the outlying areas of the district to allow for population growth in Fairfax and Loudoun. In 2013, the Fairfax portion of the district holds about 40 percent of the population, Loudoun county holds 30 percent, and the remainder of the district at 30 percent.

In the [[2011 United States federal budget]], Wolf inserted a clause prohibiting [[NASA]] and the [[Executive Office of the President of the United States|White House]] [[Office of Science and Technology Policy]] from any joint scientific activity with China for the remainder of the 2011 fiscal year.  Wolf remarked, "We don't want to give them the opportunity to take advantage of our technology, and we have nothing to gain from dealing with them.  And frankly, it boils down to a moral issue. ... Would you have a bilateral program with Stalin?"<ref>{{cite web|last=Mervis|first=Jeffrey|title=Spending Bill Prohibits U.S.-China Collaborations|url=http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2011/04/spending-bill-prohibits-us-china.html|work=ScienceInsider|publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science|accessdate=23 May 2011|date=21 April 2011}}</ref>  This prohibition resulted in Chinese journalists being denied access to the launching of [[Space Shuttle Endeavour]] on the mission [[STS-134]], that was carrying the [[Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer]] which was built in part by Chinese scientists.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hao|first=Cindy|title=Chinese Journalists Barred From Shuttle Launch|url=http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2011/05/chinese-journalists-barred-from.html|work=ScienceInsider |publisher=[[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] |accessdate=23 May 2011|date=20 May 2011}}</ref>

He also voted to make the [[Patriot Act]] permanent, opposed requiring [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act]] warrants for wiretaps within the United States, and supported the president in restricting congressional oversight for [[CIA interrogations]].<ref name="OnTheIssues"/>

However, in March 2006, Congress, at Wolf's suggestion by inserting an earmark into a supplemental appropriation bill, and in a breach with the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]], announced the creation of the [[Iraq Study Group]] to reassess the U.S. strategy in [[War in Iraq|Iraq]].<ref name="Barone2008">{{cite book
