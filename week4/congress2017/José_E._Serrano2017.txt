'''José Enrique Serrano''' (born October 24, 1943) is an [[United States|American]] politician who has been a member of the [[United States House of Representatives]] since 1990. Serrano, a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] from [[New York (state)|New York]], represents a district that is one of the smallest in the country geographically, consisting of a few square miles of the heavily urbanized and populated [[South Bronx]] in [[New York City]]. His district is also one of the most densely populated and one of the few majority Hispanic districts in the country. The district was numbered the {{ushr|NY|18|18th}} from 1990 to 1993 and the {{ushr|NY|16|16th}} from 1993 to 2013; it has been the {{ushr|NY|15|15th district}} since 2013.

==Early life, education, and military service==
Serrano was born in [[Mayagüez, Puerto Rico]]. At the age of seven, Serrano was taken by his family to [[The Bronx]], where he was raised in the Millbrook Houses. Serrano went to Grace Dodge Vocational High School in the Bronx and then attended [[Lehman College]]. He served in the [[United States Army]] medical corps from 1964 to 1966.

==New York Assembly==

He was a member of the [[New York State Assembly]] from 1975 to 1990, sitting in the [[181st New York State Legislature|181st]], [[182nd New York State Legislature|182nd]], [[183rd New York State Legislature|183rd]], [[184th New York State Legislature|184th]], [[185th New York State Legislature|185th]], [[186th New York State Legislature|186th]], [[187th New York State Legislature|187th]] and [[188th New York State Legislature]]s. His district was numbered the 75th until 1982, and the 73rd from 1983 on. He was Chairman of the Committee on Consumer Affairs, and of the Committee on Education.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
In 1990, Serrano won a special election for the seat vacated by resigning U.S. Congressman [[Robert Garcia (New York politician)|Robert García]] with 92% of the vote.<ref>[http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=107262 Ourcampaigns.com]</ref> He has never won re-election with less than 92% of the vote,<ref>[http://www.collegetermpapers.com/TermPapers/Government_&_Politics/Political_Profile_of_Jose_Serrano.shtml Collegetermpapers.com]</ref><ref>[http://www.bronxnewsnetwork.org/2010/11/bronx-general-election-results.html Bronxnewsnetwork.org]</ref> in what is considered one of the safest seats in Congress.

In 2004, Congressman Serrano faced an electoral challenge from Jose Serrano, an unemployed former loading dockworker with the same name who eventually dropped out of the race in July.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/24/nyregion/seeing-double-on-ballot-similar-names-sow-confusion.html]</ref>

===Tenure===

Serrano has consistently supported initiatives to resolve Puerto Rico's political status problem, including the 1998 Young bill, which he coauthored, and the December 22, 2005, report of the [[President's Task Force on Puerto Rico's Status]], which recommends that Congress provide an opportunity for residents in Puerto Rico to vote for or against its current status, which the report describes as an unincorporated U.S. territory and Serrano describes as a U.S. colony. Serrano filed a bill, HR 900, with Puerto Rico Resident Commissioner [[Luis Fortuño]], co-sponsored by 129 other Democratic and Republican members of Congress, to authorize such a referendum by 2009.<ref>{{cite web|last=Arroyo |first=Phillip |url=http://prdemocratcorner.blogspot.com/2008/10/congressman-serranos-testimony-on-hr.html |title=PUERTO RICO DEMOCRAT CORNER: Congressman Serrano's testimony on HR 900 (April 2007) |publisher=Prdemocratcorner.blogspot.com |date=2008-10-10 |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref>

A member of the [[Congressional Progressive Caucus|Progressive Caucus]], he is widely regarded as one of the most progressive members of Congress. He has been questioned about his [[pork barrel spending]] by some fiscal conservative members of Congress. [[Arizona]] Congressman [[Jeff Flake]] once said of Serrano's $150,000 [[Earmark (politics)|earmark]] to repair the roof at the city-owned Arthur Avenue Market (a historic indoor produce and prepared food market in the Bronx's "Little Italy"), "I would argue this is one [[cannoli]] the taxpayer doesn’t want to take a bite of."<ref name="60minutes">CBS ''60 Minutes'', [http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/11/02/60minutes/main2145860.shtml ''Rep. Flake On Cutting Congressional Pork'']. Consulted on June 27, 2007.</ref> Serrano replied to Flake, "The more you get up on these, sir, the more I realize that you do not know what you are talking about. I make no excuses about the fact that I earmark dollars to go in the poorest congressional district in the nation, which is situated in the richest city on earth."<ref name="60minutes"/>

On November 18, 2005, he was one of three votes in favor of immediate withdrawal of American troops from Iraq. The other two votes were from [[Cynthia McKinney]] of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[Robert Wexler]] of [[Florida]].<ref>[http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=05/12/01/1526209 Rep.

Res. 17]</ref> On January 3, 2013, Serrano proposed the repeal of the 22nd Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which would remove the restriction on the number of terms a President may serve.  This has been met with heavily negative backlash in social media, including a flood of so-called "hateful" comments on his Facebook page.

Serrano has paid attention to local environmental issues in New York, with a particular focus on constructing greenways, acquiring parklands, and cleaning up the Bronx River, which runs through his district.  Recently a beaver was discovered swimming in the river for the first time in 200 years, something seen as a testament to his efforts.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/23/nyregion/23beaver.html?_r=1&ei=5070&en=2ad9892ebc5bdc86&ex=1190088000&adxnnl=1&oref=slogin&adxnnlx=1190442846-peEVm1IxNq5hjoihc46nkQ After 200 Years, a Beaver Is Back in New York City]</ref>  In 2007, he engineered the purchase of the last privately owned island in New York harbor—[[South Brother Island, East River|South Brother Island]]—for preservation in perpetuity by the City of New York as a wildlife refuge for rare shorebirds.

Serrano was a critic of the Bush administration's approach to handling President [[Hugo Chávez]] of Venezuela. In 2005, while the Venezuelan President was in New York City speaking before the United Nations, the congressman invited him to his district to speak to his constituency.

Serrano is one of three New York-area congressmen on the [[U.S. House Committee on Appropriations|House Appropriations Committee]], the others being [[Nita Lowey]] of the [[New York's 18th congressional district|18th district]] and [[Steve Israel]] of [[New York's 3rd congressional district|3rd district]]. He is currently the ranking member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Financial Services, having previously served as the chair.  As chairman, he successfully engineered the inclusion of language in the 2007 omnibus spending bill that guarantees the extension of the [[50 State Quarters]] program to include the minting of 6 additional quarters to honor the District of Columbia and the 5 United States territories, including Serrano's native Puerto Rico.

Serrano has also been an advocate for [http://www.pr-secretfiles.net Puerto Ricans under FBI prosecution]. In May 2000, he brokered an agreement with then-FBI Director [[Louis Freeh]], then [[Puerto Rican Independence Party]] senator [[Manuel Rodríguez Orellana]] and then Puerto Rico Senate Federal Affairs Committee chairman [[Kenneth McClintock]], the islands' outgoing Senate President, that has resulted in the release of nearly 100,000 pages of previously secret FBI files on Puerto Rican political activists.

In the aftermath of the death of Hugo Chávez, Congressman [[José Enrique Serrano|Serrano]] wrote condolences to Chavez via ''Twitter'' describing him as a leader who "understood the needs of the poor. He was committed to empowering the powerless. R.I.P. Mr. President.”<ref>{{cite web|url=http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/03/05/17199243-world-leaders-pay-tribute-to-chavez?lite |title=World leaders pay tribute to Hugo Chavez as wave of grief washes over Latin America |publisher=Worldnews.nbcnews.com |date=2012-10-24 |accessdate=2013-03-06}}</ref> However, the comments proved controversial with some [[twitter]]ers<ref>{{cite web|last=Serrano|first=Jose|title=Hugo Chavez was a leader that understood the needs of the poor. He was committed to empowering the powerless. R.I.P.
