===Massachusetts House of Representatives===
Festa resigned his state House seat in October 2007, and Clark entered the special election to succeed him. In the campaign she emphasized her experience as an attorney and made "developing stability in state aid" her top policy issue. She won the Democratic primary in January with 65% of the vote, defeating two other Melrose Democrats.<ref name="primary-2008" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=402026 |title=MA State House - Thirty-Second Middlesex - Special Election - D Primary Race - Feb 05, 2008 |publisher=Our Campaigns}}</ref> She defeated [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] real estate businessman Mark B.

She voted in favor of a sales tax increase saying "Voting for a sales tax (increase) certainly was not an easy vote, by any means, especially in this economic climate. And one of the reasons, primary reasons, I did it was for the local aid and for the [[MBTA]]. So, to have the ink barely dry on the budget, and have the MBTA coming back and asking for a fare increase to remove draconian service cuts, is something that does make me and my constituents angry." <ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.metrowestdailynews.com/state/x737690367/Lawmakers-object-to-T-fare-talk-after-tax-increase#ixzz2hrhxvgZC |title=Lawmakers object to T fare talk after tax increase |date=August 11, 2009 |author=Johnson, Glen / Associated Press |work=Metro-West Daily News}}</ref>
