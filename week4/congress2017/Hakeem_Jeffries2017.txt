Jeffries announced he would give up his Assembly seat to run in {{ushr|New York|8}} in January 2012. The district, which includes the Brooklyn communities of Fort Greene, Clinton Hill, Bed-Stuy, Brownsville, East New York, Canarsie, Mill Basin and Coney Island along with South Ozone Park and Howard Beach in the borough of Queens, had previously been the 10th, represented by 30-year incumbent Democrat [[Edolphus Towns]]. On the steps of Brooklyn’s Borough Hall, Jeffries said: “Washington is broken. Congress is dysfunctional. People are suffering.

On June 11, 2012, former Mayor Ed Koch, Congressman Jerrold Nadler, Councilman David Greenfield, and Assemblyman Dov Hikind gathered with several other elected officials to support Jeffries and denounce Barron.  The officials described Barron as anti-Semitic and denounced his allegedly anti-Semitic statements, while also denouncing his support of [[Zimbabwe]] ruler [[Robert Mugabe]] and [[former]] Libya ruler [[Muammar Gaddafi]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Walker |first=Hunter |url=http://politicker.com/2012/06/politicians-gather-to-denounce-charles-barron-as-an-anti-semite-and-enemy-of-the-state-of-israel/ |title=Politicians Gather To Denounce Charles Barron As An 'Anti-Semite' And 'Enemy of the State of Israel' |publisher=Politicker |accessdate=2013-09-28}}</ref> Barron responded that such attacks were a distraction from bread and butter issues.<ref>[http://politicker.com/2012/06/charles-barron-dismisses-anti-semitic-press-conference-as-a-distraction/ Charles Barron Dismisses 'Anti-Semitic' Press Conference As A 'Distraction'] Politicker, June 11, 2012</ref>

[[Green Party of the United States|Green Party]] candidate [[Colin Beavan]] called on Jeffries to "get the money out of politics", noting that as of his March 2012 filing, "he had received about $180,000, or 35 percent of his funds, from Wall Street bankers and their lawyers".

Jeffries has become a high-profile critic of New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and NYPD Commissioner William Bratton, questioning whether the reduction in stop-and-frisk has been a product of mayoral administration changes or the results of a movement that brought a successful federal lawsuit, and criticizing Eric Garner’s chokehold death.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Paybarah|first1=Azi|title=Jeffries criticizes de Blasio for stop-and-frisk claim|url=http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/city-hall/2015/05/8567716/jeffries-criticizes-de-blasio-stop-and-frisk-claim|website=Capital NY|accessdate=May 10, 2015}}</ref>

In Congress, as the Congressional Black Caucus’ Whip, he has been actively involved in maintaining the CBC historic role as “the conscience of the Congress.<ref>{{cite web|title=Conscience of the Congress|url=http://www.cbcfinc.org/the-conscience-of-the-congress.html}}</ref>”   In his CBC role, he has hosted Special Orders on the House floor, including regarding voting rights (after the Supreme Court decision weakening the 1965 Voting Rights Act)<ref>{{cite web|title=Rep Jeffries –CBC Special Order on the Voting Rights Act|url=http://www.c-span.org/video/?c4368162/rep-jeffries-cbc-special-order-voting-rights-act-22513|website=c-span.org|publisher=C-SPAN|accessdate=February 23, 2013}}</ref> and in December 2014, leading CBC members in a “hands up, don’t shoot” protest to protest the killings of African-Americans by police.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bump|first1=Philip|title=Rep.

During dramatic debate on the House floor, Jeffries stood next to the Confederate battle flag, and noted he “got chills” and lamented that the “Ghosts of the Confederacy have invaded the GOP.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kaufman|first1=Scott Eric|title=What tradition does the Confederate flag represent?

With a high concentration of public housing and high unemployment in his district, Jeffries has also made an issue of HUD’s failure to adequately enforce Section 3 of its initial creating statute from 1968, which explicitly required that federally-funded capital and rehabilitation projects in public housing developments had to employ residents of those developments.  As Jeffries noted, “we can download the power of the federal government into neighborhoods that are struggling the most, without legislative action. The most promising area is Section 3.<ref>{{cite web|title=Exclusive: Congressman Hakeem Jeffries on the Failure of the House of Representatives to Pass an Unemployment Extension Bill|url=http://www.bkreader.com/2014/06/exclusive-congressman-hakeem-jeffries-speaks-on-the-failure-to-pass-an-unemployment-extension-bill-in-the-house-of-representatives/|website=bkreader|publisher=The Brooklyn Reader|accessdate=June 4, 2014}}</ref>”

===Bills===
In addition to legislation mentioned above, on April 11, 2013, Jeffries introduced the [[Prison Ship Martyrs' Monument Preservation Act (H.R. 1501; 113th Congress)]] into the [[United States House of Representatives]]. Jeffries's proposed bill would direct the [[United States Department of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] to study the suitability and feasibility of designating the [[Prison Ship Martyrs' Monument]] in [[Fort Greene Park]] in the [[New York City]] [[Borough (New York City)|borough]] of [[Brooklyn]] as a unit of the National Park System (NPS).<ref name=1501sum>{{cite web|title=H.R. 1501 – Summary|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/1501|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=1 May 2014}}</ref> Jeffries said that "as one of America's largest revolutionary war burial sites and in tribute to the patriots that lost their lives fighting for our nation's independence, this monument deserves to be considered as a unit of the National Park Service."<ref name=JeffriesPR>{{cite web|title=Bill To Preserve Brooklyn's Prison Ship Martyrs' Monument Passes The House Of Representatives|url=http://jeffries.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/rep-jeffries-denounces-callous-republican-budget|publisher=Office of Congressman Hakeem Jeffries|accessdate=1 May 2014|date=29 April 2014}}</ref> On April 28, 2014, the Prison Ship Martyrs’s Monument Preservation Act was passed by the House.<ref>{{cite web|title=H.R. 1501 (113th): Prison Ship Martyrs’ Monument Preservation Act|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/hr1501|website=govtrack.gov|publisher=Gov Track|accessdate=April 11, 2013}}</ref>

On July 15, 2014, Jeffries, who in private practice addressed intellectual property issues, introduced the [[To establish the Law School Clinic Certification Program of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (H.R. 5108; 113th Congress)]], which would establish the Law School Clinic Certification Program of the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] (USPTO) to be available to accredited [[law school]]s for the ten-year period after enactment of the Act.<ref name=5108sum>{{cite web|title=H.R. 5108 – Summary|url=https://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/5108|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=16 September 2014}}</ref>

The families of the officers, who had been assassinated in their patrol car on December 20, 2014 in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Jeffries' district, had been the recipients of significant charitable fundraising.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Mueller|first1=Benjamin|last2=Baker|first2=Al|title=2 N.Y.P.D.

===Endorsements===

During 2007, while still in his first term in the State Assembly, Jeffries publicly endorsed and supported Barack Obama, and was among Obama’s earliest supporters in Hillary Clinton’s home state.  In one interview, he noted “"When I first ran for office, some people suggested that someone with the name "Hakeem Jeffries" could never get elected and when I saw someone with the name "Barack Obama" get elected to the U.S. Senate, it certainly inspired me."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Brand|first1=Madeleine|title=Black Endorsements Divided in New York|url=http://www.npr.org/}}</ref>

While President [[Barack Obama]] does not openly support candidates in Democratic primaries, he and President [[Bill Clinton]] together took a photograph with Jeffries weeks before his 2012 Congressional primary against Councilman Charles Barron, which was effectively used in campaign literature.<ref>{{cite web|title=Obama Camp Signals Opposition To "Reckless Clown" Barron|url=http://www.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeedpolitics/obama-camp-signals-opposition-to-brooklyns-ba#.ymNrAYBMl|website=Buzzfeed.com|publisher=Buzzfeed News|accessdate=June 14, 2012}}</ref>

In a 2012 special election, Jeffries endorsed [http://assembly.state.ny.us/mem/Walter-T-Mosley/ Walter Mosley], who was successful in a special election run to succeed Jeffries in State Assembly.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Walker|first1=Hunter|title=Hakeem Jeffries Takes a Victory Lap|url=http://observer.com/2012/09/hakeem-post-game-57th-ad/|website=Observer.com|accessdate=September 17, 2012}}</ref>

The following year, Jeffries backed [[Laurie Cumbo]]<ref>{{cite web|last1=Katinas|first1=Paula|title=Cumbo picks up support from Clarke, Jeffries|url=http://www.brooklyneagle.com/articles/cumbo-picks-support-clarke-jeffries-2013-08-20-193000|website=Brooklyn Eagle|publisher=Brooklyn Daily Eagle|accessdate=August 20, 2013}}</ref> in the hotly-contested race for Brooklyn's 35th [[New York City Council|city council]] seat vacated by [[Letitia James|Tish James]], who won the City-wide race for Public Advocate, also with a Jeffries endorsement.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Powell|first1=Nick|title=James Lands Last-Minute Endorsement In Tight Public Advocate Race|url=http://archives.cityandstateny.com/james-lands-last-minute-endorsement-in-tight-public-advocate-race/|website=CityandStateNY|publisher=City and State|accessdate=September 3, 2013}}</ref>

In 2013, Jeffries endorsed in the race for Brooklyn District Attorney, the seat held since 1990 by [[Charles Hynes|Charles‘ “Joe” Hynes]], whose office was facing deep criticism for wrongful convictions and botched prosecutions.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Sapien|first1=Joaquin|title=Charles Hynes, Scandal-Plagued Brooklyn District Attorney, Faces Verdict At The Polls|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/06/charles-hynes-brooklyn-district-attorney-election_n_3881395.html|website=Huffington Post|accessdate=September 6, 2013}}</ref> He endorsed [[Kenneth P. Thompson|Kenneth Thompson]], whom Jeffries had met while interning at the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District in the 1990s, when Thompson was a prosecutor.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/null/2012/01/5031244/announcing-his-campaign-hakeem-jeffries-talks-loudly-about-obama-and-qu|title=Announcing His Campaign Hakeem Jeffries Talks Loudly About Obama and Quietly About Ed Towns|publisher=Capital New York}}</ref>

According to journalists, the Jeffries endorsement of Thompson’s campaign was critical, and was followed by endorsements of Thompson by Brooklyn’s three other Democratic members of Congress.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Pillifant|first1=Reid|title=After an aborted Hynes endorsement, Yvette Clarke joins Hakeem Jeffries to back a challenger|url=http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/politics/2013/06/8531026/after-aborted-hynes-endorsement-yvette-clarke-joins-hakeem-jeffries|website=CapitalNewYork|accessdate=June 17, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Powell|first1=Michael|title=Brooklyn’s newest Congressman Hakeem Jeffries [Led] the way for Thompson,|url=https://twitter.com/powellnyt/status/387411998746894336|website=Twitter.com|publisher=Michael Powell}}</ref> Thompson won the Democratic primary and defeated Hynes again in the general election when the DA elected to run as a Republican in the majority Democratic borough.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Yee|first1=Vivian|title=Brooklyn Prosecutor, in Reversal, Will Run as a Republican to Keep his Job|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/04/nyregion/hynes-to-run-for-district-attorney-as-a-republican.html|website=nytimes.com|publisher=New York Times}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Baker|first1=Al|title=Paterson Signs Bill Limiting Stop-and-Frisk Data|url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/07/16/paterson-signs-bill-limiting-street-stop-data/|website=CityRoom-Blogs|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=July 16, 2010}}</ref>

In the 2013 NYC mayoral race, Jeffries endorsed City Comptroller [[Bill Thompson (New York politician)|Bill Thompson]], hailing his experience in City government. Jeffies also noted he was offended by [[Bill de Blasio]]'s ad featuring [[stop and frisk]] claiming himself as the only candidate who would address, modify or reform stop and frisk: {{quote|"In some ways, I'm offended by the notion that one individual, in a city of eight million people, after years and years and years of many of us, in the state legislature and the City Council, activists, marches that took place, including one on Father's Day, to get us to a point where all of the major mayoral candidates have said stop and frisk will be significantly reformed on their watch."}} His support of Thompson over de Blasio came in spite of Jeffries' own support of two policing bills, for independent inspector general for the police department and to allow for bias suits in state court, which de Blasio backed but Thompson did not. Jeffries said it made sense for Thompson, because he was running to be the city's top executive, not to support them.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/politics/2013/08/8533116/offended-de-blasios-ad-hakeem-jeffries-endorses-bill-thompson|title='Offended' by de Blasio's ad, Hakeem Jeffries endorses Bill Thompson|last=Pillifant|first=Reid|date=Aug 22, 2013|publisher=Capital New York}}</ref>

In 2014, he supported Rubain Dorancy as Democratic candidate for state senate, who lost to [[Jesse Hamilton]]<ref>http://www.brooklyneagle.com/articles/2014/9/16/praise-brooklyn%E2%80%99s-democratic-leader-seddio-post-primary-breakfast</ref> by a wide margin.<ref>http://www.theyeshivaworld.com/news/headlines-breaking-stories/257627/crown-heights-jesse-hamilton-wins-big-in-senate-vote.html</ref>

In that state senate race, as in several others since 2012, Jeffries has endorsed opponents of candidates endorsed by current Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams, which has created the perception of a rivalry between the two prominent elected officials, Both Jeffries and Adams have dismissed these perceptions, noting their shared history (they had together served as prime co-sponsors of the 2010 stop-frisk database bill in the state legislature) with Jeffries adding.: “Over the years, we’ve often disagreed about the best candidate for our community. But when the election is over, we should all work together to get things done.”<ref>{{cite web|last1=Paybarah|first1=Azi|title=The great not-rivals of Central Brooklyn politics|url=http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/city-hall/2014/10/8553442/great-not-rivals-central-brooklyn-politics#|website=CapitalNewYork|accessdate=October 2, 2014}}</ref>

In 2015, calls were been made among prominent African-American pastors for Jeffries to step into the 2017 Democratic primary for Mayor against Bill de Blasio. Jeffries has stated that he has “no interest” and wishes to remain an effective member of Congress.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gartland|first1=Michael|title=Watch your back, de Blasio!
