'''Trent Franks''' (born June 19, 1957) is the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|Arizona|8|}}, serving in Congress since 2003. He is a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].  The district, numbered as the 2nd District from 2003 to 2013, is located in the [[West Valley (Phoenix metropolitan area)|West Valley]] portion of the [[Phoenix metropolitan area|Valley of the Sun]] and includes [[Glendale, Arizona|Glendale]], [[Surprise, Arizona|Surprise]], [[Sun City, Arizona|Sun City]], [[Peoria, Arizona|Peoria]] and part of western Phoenix.

==Early life, education, and business career==
Franks was born in [[Uravan, Colorado]], a [[company town]], the son of Juanita and Edward Taylor Franks.<ref>http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/%7Ebattle/reps/franks.htm</ref> He was born with a [[cleft lip and palate]].  After his parents separated, Franks took care of his younger siblings. While his parents took financial responsibility, he overtook the leadership role at home.<ref name="GT"/> Franks graduated from [[Briggsdale, Colorado|Briggsdale High School]] in Colorado in 1976.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.classmates.com/directory/public/memberprofile/list.htm?regId=476953721 |accessdate=2009-09-29 |publisher=Classmates.com |title=Trent Franks}}</ref> After high school, Franks bought a drilling rig and moved to Texas to drill wells with his best friend and his younger brother.

==Early political career==

===Arizona legislature===
In 1984, while working as an engineer for an oil and gas royalty-purchasing firm, he began his political career by running for a seat in the [[Arizona House of Representatives]], against incumbent Democrat Glen Davis, an attorney, in District 20 in central Phoenix. Franks, who was a member of the Arizona Right to Life organization and president of the Arizona Christian Action Council, campaigned against abortion and in favor of tougher child abuse laws. He defeated Davis by 155 votes.<ref>{{cite news |work=Mohave Daily Miner |date=November 7, 1984 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=wrMOAAAAIBAJ&sjid=sYIDAAAAIBAJ&pg=7065,668571&dq=trent-franks |title=Republicans hold fast on Senate control |page=7 |publisher=UPI}}</ref> In the state legislature, Franks served as vice-chairman of the Commerce Committee and Chairman of the House Subcommittee on Child Protection and Family Preservation.

Franks was defeated in his re-election bid in November 1986.<ref>{{cite news |work=Mohave Daily Miner |date=November 5, 1986 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=z3gLAAAAIBAJ&sjid=dFMDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5983,430253&dq=trent-franks |title=Legislature results are split |page=16 |publisher=UPI}}</ref>

===Mecham administration===
In January 1987, he was appointed by Republican [[Governor of Arizona|Governor]] [[Evan Mecham]] to head the Arizona Governor's Office for Children, which is a Cabinet-level division of the Governor's office responsible for overseeing and coordinating state policy and programs for Arizona's children.

In late 1987, Franks founded the Arizona [[Family Research Institute]], a nonprofit organization affiliated with [[James Dobson]]'s [[Focus on the Family]].<ref name="Widening">{{cite news |work=Kingman Daily Miner |date=December 18, 2002 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=C4ALAAAAIBAJ&sjid=O1MDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6856,8863189&dq=trent-franks |title=Franks seeks widening of school tax credits |author=Ken Hedler}}</ref> He was the Executive Director of the organization for four and a half years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.house.gov/franks/bio_introduction.shtml |title=Extended Biography of Congressman Trent Franks |publisher=Trent Franks Congressional website |accessdate=2009-09-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090901001758/http://www.house.gov/franks/bio_introduction.shtml |archivedate=2009-09-01 |df= }}</ref>

In April 1988, after Mecham was impeached and removed from office, Franks and other appointees resigned their positions. Franks had been under investigation following an [[Associated Press]] report about his decision to spend nearly $60,000, without getting bids, for a conference at a former campaign contributor's hotel.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=e5wOAAAAIBAJ&sjid=NYEDAAAAIBAJ&pg=7072,1408752&dq=trent-franks |work=Prescott Courier |date=April 8, 1988 |title=Mecham aides quit, another will leave |agency=Associated Press |page=6A}}</ref> Later in 1988, Franks ran again for a legislative seat, moving to District 18 shortly before the filing deadline.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=IZAOAAAAIBAJ&sjid=WIEDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3583,2247028&dq=trent-franks |work=Prescott Courier |date= September 11, 1988 |title=Campaign called 'dirtiest' in recent memory |agency=Associated Press |page=1}}</ref> He was successful in the Republican primary but lost in the November general election.

===Political activism===
In 1992, when Franks was chairman of [[Arizonans for Common Sense]], one of the organization's efforts was a constitutional amendment on the November 1992 ballot in Arizona that banned most abortions.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=uxwOAAAAIBAJ&sjid=qH0DAAAAIBAJ&pg=2066,7041640&dq=trent-franks |work=Prescott Courier |date=June 29, 1992 |title=Abortion ruling bodes ill for Arizona |agency=Associated Press |page=1B}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |work=Miami Herald |date=July 1, 1992 |title=Politics of Abortion Likely to Inflame Elections in States |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=MH&s_site=miami&p_multi=MH&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB346F474DCA04D&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM }}</ref> The initiative lost, [[List of Arizona ballot propositions#1992|getting about 35 percent of the votes cast]].

In August 1995, [[Arizonans for an Empowered Future]], of which Franks was chairman, launched an initiative campaign to amend the state constitution, replacing the graduated state income tax with a flat 3.5 percent rate, and allowing parents to deduct the costs of private-school tuition.<ref>{{cite news |work=Kingman Daily Miner |date=August 2, 1995 |title=Arizona initiative seeks flat tax, credits for private school tuition |author=William F.

The district, which had previously been the 3rd district, had come open after 13-term incumbent [[Bob Stump]] had announced his retirement.  The initial favorite in the race was Lisa Jackson Atkins, Stump's longtime chief of staff, whom Stump had endorsed as his successor. Atkins had long been very visible in the district (in contrast to her more low-key boss) to the point that many thought she was the district's representative. Franks narrowly defeated Atkins in the seven-candidate Republican primary, 28%–26%, a difference of just 797 votes.<ref>{{cite news |work=The Daily Courier |date=September 2, 2002 |title=Many Arizona House candidates financing own primary campaigns |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=vEwLAAAAIBAJ&sjid=11IDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6776,365885&dq=trent-franks |agency=Associated Press |author=Robert Gehrke }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=1042|title=Our Campaigns - AZ District 2 - R Primary Race - Sep 10, 2002|publisher=}}</ref> He won the November 2002 general election, defeating Democrat Randy Camacho, 60%–37%.<ref name="Widening"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=1041|title=Our Campaigns - AZ District 2 Race - Nov 05, 2002|publisher=}}</ref>

;2012
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Arizona, 2012#District 8}}
For his first five terms, Franks represented a vast district encompassing most of northwestern Arizona, though the bulk of its population was in the West Valley.  It appeared to be gerrymandered because of a narrow tendril connecting the Hopi reservation to the rest of the district.  However, due to longstanding disputes between the Hopi and Navajo, it had long been believed the two tribes should be in separate districts.

However, after the 2010 census, Franks' district was renumbered as the 8th District, and reduced to essentially the [[Maricopa County]] portion of his old district. As evidence of how much the West Valley dominated the old 2nd, Franks retained 92 percent of his former constituents, even as he lost 85 percent of his old district's land.<ref>[http://www.dailykos.com/story/2011/10/04/1022899/-Arizona-Redistricting-Commission-releases-draft-map Arizona Redistricting: Commission releases draft map].

===Positions===
The ''[[National Journal]]'' has ranked Franks among the "most conservative" members of the U.S. House of Representatives in 2009.<ref>{{cite web| last =Roff| first =Peter| title =The Most Conservative and Most Liberal Members of Congress| publisher =[[U.S. News & World Report]]| date =2010-02-26| url =http://www.usnews.com/blogs/peter-roff/2010/02/26/the-most-conservative-and-most-liberal-members-of-congress.html| accessdate =2010-03-07 }}</ref> He is a member of the [[Republican Study Committee]].

====Homeland security====
On October 14, 2009, Franks joined with three fellow Representatives in calling for the investigation of the [[Council on American-Islamic Relations]] (CAIR) over allegations of trying to plant "spies," based on a CAIR memo indicating that they "will develop national initiatives such as Lobby Day, and placing Muslim interns in Congressional offices."  The request followed publication of the book ''[[Muslim Mafia (book)|Muslim Mafia]]''. Representative [[Sue Myrick]] had written the foreword, which characterized CAIR as subversive and aligned with terrorists.<ref name=co>[http://www.charlotteobserver.com/topstories/story/1047173.html Doyle, Michael, "Judge: Controversial 'Muslim Mafia' used stolen papers", ''[[Charlotte Observer]]'', November 10, 2009, accessed November 17, 2009]{{dead link|date=March 2014}}</ref>  CAIR has countered that these initiatives are extensively used by all advocacy groups and accused Franks and his colleagues of intending to intimidate American Muslims who "take part in the political process and exercise their rights."<ref>{{cite news |publisher=Salon.com |date=October 15, 2009 |url=http://www.salon.com/opinion/greenwald/2009/10/15/investigation/index.html |title=

In 2009 Franks signed a pledge sponsored by [[Americans for Prosperity]] promising to vote against any Global Warming legislation that would raise taxes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://americansforprosperity.org/noclimatetax/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219061216/http://americansforprosperity.org/noclimatetax/ |archivedate=2015-02-19 |df= }}/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/franks.pdf</ref>

====Criticism of the Obama Administration====
He opposes the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], claiming "the thought of Americans' health care decisions being put into the hands of an unimaginably large bureaucracy is a frightening prospect."<ref>Trent Franks, [http://www.franks.house.gov/pages/health-care], 2011</ref> He is not supported by [[American Public Health Association]] or the [[Children's Health Fund]].<ref>[http://www.votesmart.org/candidate/evaluations/28399/trent-franks/38], 2011</ref>

In September 2009, he stirred controversy when criticizing President [[Barack Obama]]. He said "Obama's first act as president of any consequence, in the middle of a financial meltdown, was to send taxpayers' money overseas to pay for the killing of unborn children in other countries. Now, I got to tell you, if a president will do that, there's almost nothing that you should be surprised at after that. We shouldn't be shocked that he does all these other insane things. A president that has lost his way that badly, that has no ability to see the image of God in these little fellow human beings, if he can't do that right, then he has no place in any station of government and we need to realize that he is an enemy of humanity."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-5350756-503544.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111107220202/http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-5350756-503544.html |archivedate=November 7, 2011 }}</ref>

====Abortion====
In a 2010 interview, discussing the legacy of [[slavery]] which Franks described as a "crushing mark on America's soul", the congressman said, "Half of all black children are aborted.

In June 2013, he proposed a bill that would ban abortions after 20 weeks without exceptions for [[rape]] and [[incest]]. In defense, he stirred controversy when saying that "the incidents of rape resulting in pregnancy are very low."

Franks presided over a hearing to ban abortions in the [[District of Columbia]], in which he did not allow D.C.'s lone [[Delegate (United States Congress)|delegate]] and [[Member of Congress]], Congresswoman [[Eleanor Holmes Norton]], to testify. In doing so, he said Congress has the authority to "exercise exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever" in the District, even though the heavily [[U.S. Democratic Party|Democratic]] district is strongly opposed to the ban.<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/2012/05/17/gIQAAcEGXU_story.html], 2012</ref>
