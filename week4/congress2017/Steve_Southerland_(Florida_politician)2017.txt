Southerland faced seven-term Democratic incumbent [[Allen Boyd]] in the November general election. Independent candidates Paul C. McKain and Dianne Berryhill were also on the ballot, and Ray Netherwood had qualified as a write-in candidate.

[[Real Clear Politics]] rated this race a "Leans GOP".<ref>{{cite news|title=Florida 2nd District - Southerland vs. Boyd|date=October 28, 2010|url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2010/house/fl/florida_2nd_district_southerland_vs_boyd-1372.html|work=[[Real Clear Politics]]|accessdate=October 29, 2010}}</ref> [[CQ Politics]] rated the election as a toss up.<ref>[http://www.cqpolitics.com/wmspage.cfm?parm1=5 CQPolitics]</ref>

In the November 2 general election, Southerland defeated Boyd with 52 percent of the vote. Southerland is the first freshman Republican to represent the 2nd since its formation in 1963 (it was the 9th District from 1963–1967 and has been the 2nd since 1967).<ref>{{cite news|last1=Bojorquez|first1=Manuel|title=Fla. congressman hears it from constituents about Syria|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/fla-congressman-hears-it-from-constituents-about-syria/|accessdate=September 8, 2014|publisher=CBS News|date=September 4, 2013}}</ref> The only other Republican to ever represent this district, [[James W.

Southerland has stated that he wants to replace the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|Affordable Care Act]] “with an approach that incorporates free-market principles.

He voiced support for tort reform to help prevent frivolous lawsuits against doctors." ”<ref>{{cite news|last1=Olwell|first1=Chris|title=Medical group endorses Southerland|url=http://www.newsherald.com/news/government/medical-group-endorses-southerland-1.361822?page=1|accessdate=September 8, 2014|publisher=News Herald|date=August 20, 2014}}</ref>
