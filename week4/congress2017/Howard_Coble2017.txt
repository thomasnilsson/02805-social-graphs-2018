'''John Howard Coble''' (March 18, 1931 – November 3, 2015) was a [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|NC|6}}, serving from 1985 to 2015. He was a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. The district includes all or portions of ten counties in the northern-central part of the state, including portions of [[Greensboro, North Carolina|Greensboro]] and [[Durham, North Carolina|Durham]].

==Early life, education, and pre-political career==
Coble was born in [[Greensboro, North Carolina]], the son of Johnnie E. (Holt) and Joseph Howard Coble.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~battle/reps/coble.htm|title=coble|work=ancestry.com|accessdate=5 November 2015}}</ref> After high school, he initially attended [[Appalachian State University]], but after a year joined the [[United States Coast Guard]], serving for over 5 years and staying on as a reservist for an additional 18 years. Upon discharging from military service, he attended [[Guilford College]], from which he received a history degree. He was a member of the Epsilon Iota Chapter of [[Pi Kappa Phi]] fraternity at [[The University of North Carolina at Greensboro]]. Coble then moved on to the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] and earned a degree in law.

After graduating from college, Coble first worked as an insurance agent. He then spent nearly 20 years as a practicing attorney, and he was also Secretary of Revenue under North Carolina Governor [[James Holshouser]]. In 1979, Coble was elected to the [[North Carolina House of Representatives]], serving until his election to Congress.

===Elections===
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in North Carolina, 2012#District 6}}
Coble was first elected to Congress in 1984, narrowly defeating Walter Cockerham in the primary 51%–49%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=66122|title=Our Campaigns – NC District 6 – R Primary Race – May 08, 1984|work=ourcampaigns.com|accessdate=31 August 2015}}</ref> In the general election, he defeated one-term [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] incumbent [[Robin Britt]] 51%–49%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=52123|title=Our Campaigns – NC District 6 Race – Nov 06, 1984|work=ourcampaigns.com|accessdate=31 August 2015}}</ref> Coble was likely the beneficiary of long coattails from [[Ronald Reagan]], who carried the district by a nearly 2-to-1 margin. In 1986, he defeated Britt in a rematch, which was an even closer 50.03%–49.97% and Coble won by only 79 votes (closest margin of victory that year). Since then, he has never won re-election with less than 61% of the vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/CandidateDetail.html?CandidateID=1404|title=Our Campaigns – Candidate – J. Howard Coble|work=ourcampaigns.com|accessdate=31 August 2015}}</ref> In July 2008, Coble won the Republican primary unopposed and became North Carolina's longest-serving Republican U.S. congressman, surpassing former U.S. Congressman [[Jim Broyhill]] (who was also elected to 12 terms but left the House in July 1986 to fill a vacant U.S. Senate seat). Coble announced in 2013 that he would not run for another term in [[United States House of Representatives elections in North Carolina, 2014|2014]], and would retire after 30 years in Congress.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2013/11/07/rep-howard-coble-r-n-c-to-retire/|title=Rep. Howard Coble (R-N.C.) to retire|author=Aaron Blake|date=7 November 2013|work=Washington Post|accessdate=31 August 2015}}</ref>

===Tenure===
In the [[105th Congress|105th United States Congress]] Coble moved to suspend the rules and pass the [[NET Act]] on November 4, 1997, which removed the requirement of financial gain for criminal prosecution of copyright violation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/F?r105:2:./temp/~r105t9SOlO:e46:|title=Weekend Maintenance – Library of Congress|work=loc.gov|accessdate=31 August 2015}}</ref>  The NET Act was passed only after the House suspended the rules.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d105:HR02265:@@@Z|title=Weekend Maintenance – Library of Congress|work=loc.gov|accessdate=31 August 2015}}</ref>

Coble was a strong supporter of agriculture and had voted in favor of bills to protect agriculture. Coble opposed further regulation of [[tobacco]] because he believed it would hurt North Carolina tobacco planters.

Coble took a hard-line position on illegal drugs, and co-sponsored a resolution to oppose the legalization and use of [[medical marijuana]].<ref name="Govtrack">{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=hj105-117|title=Expressing the sense of Congress that marijuana is a dangerous and addictive drug and should not be legalized for medicinal use. (1998; 105th Congress H.J.Res. 117) – GovTrack.us|work=GovTrack.us|accessdate=31 August 2015}}</ref> He also voted for an amendment to authorize [[drug testing]] on federal employees.<ref name="Govtrack" /> However, he authored a resolution to celebrate the passage of [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-first Amendment]], which repealed the Prohibition of [[alcoholic beverages]] in the United States.<ref name="Govtrack" /> Coble was also a member of the [[Tea Party Caucus]], joining [[Sue Myrick]] and [[Walter B. Jones]] as the sole members of the North Carolina Congressional delegation to join the group.

Coble pledged not to receive any pension from the [[United States government]].  He told [[CBS]] ''[[Up to the Minute]]'', "I figured taxpayers pay my salary – not a bad salary, and I figure that's sufficient.  Let me fend for myself after the salary's collected." He also stated to CBS, "I've pledged my assurance I won't take the pension. That's between my constituents and me. As far as convicted felons, I guess that's between their constituents and themselves."  He was one of two Congressmen, with [[Ron Paul]], to have pledged to decline his pension.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/12/22/eveningnews/main6011719.shtml |title=Pensions Follow Ex-Lawmakers to Prison |work=CBS News |date=December 22, 2009}}</ref>

However, during the government shutdown in October 2013.  Coble said that although 800,000 federal workers are furloughed and not receiving a paycheck, he will still collect his salary due to a requirement of law.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2013/10/03/cnn-keeps-count-congress-gets-paid-but-whos-keeping-their-paycheck/?hpt=hp_t1 |title=CNN Keeps Count... |work=CNN |date=October 3, 2013}}</ref>  Coble was one of the 87 Republicans who voted for the bill to end the shutdown on October 16.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/politics/congress-votes-to-end-shutdown/house.html?Post+generic=%3Ftid%3Dsm_twitter_washingtonpost | work=The Washington Post}}</ref>

In June 2013, Coble announced introduction of new legislation to reform the [[congressional pension]] program. Coble refused to participate in the congressional pension program, stating that reforming congressional pensions was long overdue and that the bill would lengthen the time of service required before a member would be eligible for participation in the pension program.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://coble.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=339584 |title=High Point Enterprise praises Coble pension bill |date=June 18, 2013 |website=house.gov |publisher=U.S. House of Representatives |accessdate=16 July 2013}}</ref>

===Legislation sponsored===
The bill [[To extend the Undetectable Firearms Act of 1988 for 10 years (H.R. 3626; 113th Congress)]] was introduced in the House on December 2, 2013 by Coble.<ref name=3626allactions>{{cite web|title=H.R. 3626 – All Actions|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/3626/all-actions/|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=5 December 2013}}</ref> The bill would extend the [[Undetectable Firearms Act of 1988]] for an additional 10 years, but would not expand any of its provisions (related to plastic guns).<ref name=foxnewsHousevotes>{{cite news|title=House votes to renew ban on plastic firearms|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/12/03/house-to-vote-on-banning-plastic-firearms/?intcmp=latestnews|accessdate=5 December 2013|newspaper=Foxnews.com|date=3 December 2013}}</ref> The bill passed the House on December 3, 2013.

==Personal life==
As a young man, Coble frequently enjoyed eating a breakfast of Rose brand pork brains in milk gravy and eggs. According to a quote from Coble appearing alongside his family recipe for "Breakfast Brains N' Eggs," the breakfast was "fairly regular" and "not at all unusual".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Coble|first1=Howard|title=Favorite Breakfast "Brains N' Eggs"|url=http://virtualcities.com/ons/nc/gov/ncgvhc1.htm|website=Congress Cooks!|accessdate=30 January 2016}}</ref>

'''John Howard Coble''' (March 18, 1931 – November 3, 2015) was a [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|NC|6}}, serving from 1985 to 2015. He was a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. The district includes all or portions of ten counties in the northern-central part of the state, including portions of [[Greensboro, North Carolina|Greensboro]] and [[Durham, North Carolina|Durham]].

==Early life, education, and pre-political career==
Coble was born in [[Greensboro, North Carolina]], the son of Johnnie E. (Holt) and Joseph Howard Coble.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~battle/reps/coble.htm|title=coble|work=ancestry.com|accessdate=5 November 2015}}</ref> After high school, he initially attended [[Appalachian State University]], but after a year joined the [[United States Coast Guard]], serving for over 5 years and staying on as a reservist for an additional 18 years. Upon discharging from military service, he attended [[Guilford College]], from which he received a history degree. He was a member of the Epsilon Iota Chapter of [[Pi Kappa Phi]] fraternity at [[The University of North Carolina at Greensboro]]. Coble then moved on to the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] and earned a degree in law.

After graduating from college, Coble first worked as an insurance agent. He then spent nearly 20 years as a practicing attorney, and he was also Secretary of Revenue under North Carolina Governor [[James Holshouser]]. In 1979, Coble was elected to the [[North Carolina House of Representatives]], serving until his election to Congress.

===Elections===
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in North Carolina, 2012#District 6}}
Coble was first elected to Congress in 1984, narrowly defeating Walter Cockerham in the primary 51%–49%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=66122|title=Our Campaigns – NC District 6 – R Primary Race – May 08, 1984|work=ourcampaigns.com|accessdate=31 August 2015}}</ref> In the general election, he defeated one-term [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] incumbent [[Robin Britt]] 51%–49%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=52123|title=Our Campaigns – NC District 6 Race – Nov 06, 1984|work=ourcampaigns.com|accessdate=31 August 2015}}</ref> Coble was likely the beneficiary of long coattails from [[Ronald Reagan]], who carried the district by a nearly 2-to-1 margin. In 1986, he defeated Britt in a rematch, which was an even closer 50.03%–49.97% and Coble won by only 79 votes (closest margin of victory that year). Since then, he has never won re-election with less than 61% of the vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/CandidateDetail.html?CandidateID=1404|title=Our Campaigns – Candidate – J. Howard Coble|work=ourcampaigns.com|accessdate=31 August 2015}}</ref> In July 2008, Coble won the Republican primary unopposed and became North Carolina's longest-serving Republican U.S. congressman, surpassing former U.S. Congressman [[Jim Broyhill]] (who was also elected to 12 terms but left the House in July 1986 to fill a vacant U.S. Senate seat). Coble announced in 2013 that he would not run for another term in [[United States House of Representatives elections in North Carolina, 2014|2014]], and would retire after 30 years in Congress.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2013/11/07/rep-howard-coble-r-n-c-to-retire/|title=Rep.

===Tenure===
In the [[105th Congress|105th United States Congress]] Coble moved to suspend the rules and pass the [[NET Act]] on November 4, 1997, which removed the requirement of financial gain for criminal prosecution of copyright violation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/F?r105:2:./temp/~r105t9SOlO:e46:|title=Weekend Maintenance – Library of Congress|work=loc.gov|accessdate=31 August 2015}}</ref>  The NET Act was passed only after the House suspended the rules.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d105:HR02265:@@@Z|title=Weekend Maintenance – Library of Congress|work=loc.gov|accessdate=31 August 2015}}</ref>

Coble was a strong supporter of agriculture and had voted in favor of bills to protect agriculture. Coble opposed further regulation of [[tobacco]] because he believed it would hurt North Carolina tobacco planters.

Coble took a hard-line position on illegal drugs, and co-sponsored a resolution to oppose the legalization and use of [[medical marijuana]].<ref name="Govtrack">{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=hj105-117|title=Expressing the sense of Congress that marijuana is a dangerous and addictive drug and should not be legalized for medicinal use. (1998; 105th Congress H.J.Res. 117) – GovTrack.us|work=GovTrack.us|accessdate=31 August 2015}}</ref> He also voted for an amendment to authorize [[drug testing]] on federal employees.<ref name="Govtrack" /> However, he authored a resolution to celebrate the passage of [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-first Amendment]], which repealed the Prohibition of [[alcoholic beverages]] in the United States.<ref name="Govtrack" /> Coble was also a member of the [[Tea Party Caucus]], joining [[Sue Myrick]] and [[Walter B. Jones]] as the sole members of the North Carolina Congressional delegation to join the group.

Coble pledged not to receive any pension from the [[United States government]].  He told [[CBS]] ''[[Up to the Minute]]'', "I figured taxpayers pay my salary – not a bad salary, and I figure that's sufficient.  Let me fend for myself after the salary's collected." He also stated to CBS, "I've pledged my assurance I won't take the pension. That's between my constituents and me. As far as convicted felons, I guess that's between their constituents and themselves."  He was one of two Congressmen, with [[Ron Paul]], to have pledged to decline his pension.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/12/22/eveningnews/main6011719.shtml |title=Pensions Follow Ex-Lawmakers to Prison |work=CBS News |date=December 22, 2009}}</ref>

However, during the government shutdown in October 2013.  Coble said that although 800,000 federal workers are furloughed and not receiving a paycheck, he will still collect his salary due to a requirement of law.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2013/10/03/cnn-keeps-count-congress-gets-paid-but-whos-keeping-their-paycheck/?hpt=hp_t1 |title=CNN Keeps Count... |work=CNN |date=October 3, 2013}}</ref>  Coble was one of the 87 Republicans who voted for the bill to end the shutdown on October 16.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/politics/congress-votes-to-end-shutdown/house.html?Post+generic=%3Ftid%3Dsm_twitter_washingtonpost | work=The Washington Post}}</ref>

In June 2013, Coble announced introduction of new legislation to reform the [[congressional pension]] program. Coble refused to participate in the congressional pension program, stating that reforming congressional pensions was long overdue and that the bill would lengthen the time of service required before a member would be eligible for participation in the pension program.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://coble.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=339584 |title=High Point Enterprise praises Coble pension bill |date=June 18, 2013 |website=house.gov |publisher=U.S. House of Representatives |accessdate=16 July 2013}}</ref>

===Legislation sponsored===
The bill [[To extend the Undetectable Firearms Act of 1988 for 10 years (H.R. 3626; 113th Congress)]] was introduced in the House on December 2, 2013 by Coble.<ref name=3626allactions>{{cite web|title=H.R. 3626 – All Actions|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/3626/all-actions/|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=5 December 2013}}</ref> The bill would extend the [[Undetectable Firearms Act of 1988]] for an additional 10 years, but would not expand any of its provisions (related to plastic guns).<ref name=foxnewsHousevotes>{{cite news|title=House votes to renew ban on plastic firearms|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/12/03/house-to-vote-on-banning-plastic-firearms/?intcmp=latestnews|accessdate=5 December 2013|newspaper=Foxnews.com|date=3 December 2013}}</ref> The bill passed the House on December 3, 2013.

==Personal life==
As a young man, Coble frequently enjoyed eating a breakfast of Rose brand pork brains in milk gravy and eggs. According to a quote from Coble appearing alongside his family recipe for "Breakfast Brains N' Eggs," the breakfast was "fairly regular" and "not at all unusual".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Coble|first1=Howard|title=Favorite Breakfast "Brains N' Eggs"|url=http://virtualcities.com/ons/nc/gov/ncgvhc1.htm|website=Congress Cooks!|accessdate=30 January 2016}}</ref>
