She took about a dozen questions at each, the majority of which “were in opposition to Shea-Porter's health care vote.”<ref name="ULdisrupt">[http://www.unionleader.com/article.aspx?headline=Tempers+hot+at+Shea-Porter+health+meetings&articleId=bbfc20cf-7050-40f0-a894-d72828de6399 "Tempers hot at Shea-Porter health meetings" Union Leader (August 30, 2010)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209172800/http://www.unionleader.com/article.aspx?headline=Tempers+hot+at+Shea-Porter+health+meetings&articleId=bbfc20cf-7050-40f0-a894-d72828de6399 |date=February 9, 2010 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.wmur.com/politics/23018268/detail.html "Protesters Question Shea-Porter On Health Care Law: Tea Party Members Plan Protests At Town Hall Meetings" WMUR (March 31, 2010)]</ref>
