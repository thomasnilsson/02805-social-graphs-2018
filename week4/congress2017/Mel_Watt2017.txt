==Law career==
Watt practiced law from 1970 to 1992, specializing in minority business and economic development law.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} He has been a partner in several small businesses.<ref name="davidson dispatch2"/>

==Early political career==
Watt was the campaign manager of [[Harvey Gantt]]'s campaigns for Mayor of Charlotte and for the [[United States Senate election in North Carolina, 1990]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Smothers|first=Ronald|title=THE 1990 ELECTIONS; North Carolina Democrat Sets Strategy in Taking On Helms|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1990/06/07/us/the-1990-elections-north-carolina-democrat-sets-strategy-in-taking-on-helms.html?pagewanted=2&src=pm|accessdate=7 January 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=7 June 1990}}</ref> Watt served one term in the [[North Carolina Senate]] (1985–86).<ref name="ncdp">{{cite web|title=Congressman Mel Watt|url=http://www.ncdp.org/candidates/profile/congressman-mel-watt/|work=NCDP.org|publisher=North Carolina Democratic Party|accessdate=16 December 2011}}</ref>

==U.S. House of Representatives==
In 1992, Watt entered the Democratic primary for the newly created 12th District, a 64 percent black-majority district stretching from [[Gastonia, North Carolina|Gastonia]] to [[Durham, North Carolina|Durham]].  He won the four-way Democratic primary—the real contest in this heavily Democratic district—with 47 percent of the vote.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=270846</ref>  He then easily won [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1992|the general election]] by defeating Barbara Gore Washington ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]) and Curtis Wade Krumel ([[Libertarian Party (United States)|L]]) with 70 percent of the vote, becoming the first Democrat to represent a significant portion of Charlotte since 1953.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=28268</ref>  In 1993, the original version of his district was thrown out in ''[[Shaw v. Reno]],'' and was reconfigured to exclude its far western and far eastern portions.  The new 12th, however, was no less Democratic than its predecessor, and Watt was reelected 10 more times.  He only faced one relatively close race, when Republican Scott Keadle held him to 55 percent in 1998.

Watt was arguably the most liberal member of North Carolina's congressional delegation, and one of the most liberal congressmen ever to represent the state.  For most of his tenure, he was a member of the [[Congressional Progressive Caucus]].

==Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency==

===Nomination and confirmation===
On May 1, 2013, President Obama announced his intent to nominate Watt to serve as the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency.  Almost immediately, the nomination drew criticism from Republicans, some of whom complained that no politician should lead the agency.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2013/05/mel-watt-to-head-fhfa-90816.html |title=Mel Watt nomination faces long odds |first=Jon |last=Prior |first2=MJ |last2=Lee |publisher=Politico |date=2013-05-02 |accessdate=2013-10-31}}</ref>  Other Republican senators have argued that he lacks technical expertise on housing finance.<ref name="reuters1">{{cite web|last=Chadbourn |first=Margaret |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/10/28/us-usa-housing-watt-idUSBRE99R0UE20131028 |title=White House mounts push to win confirmation for housing nominee |publisher=Reuters |date=October 28, 2013 |accessdate=2013-10-31}}</ref>  Obama formally nominated Watt to the post on May 7, 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/05/07/presidential-nominations-sent-senate |title=Presidential Nominations Sent to the Senate |publisher=Whitehouse.gov |date=2013-05-07 |accessdate=2013-10-31}}</ref>

In July 2013, the Senate Banking Committee advanced Watt's nomination on a party-line vote.<ref name="reuters1"/>

On October 28, 2013, Senate Majority Leader [[Harry Reid]] motioned to invoke [[cloture]] on Watt's nomination, setting up a key test of whether his nomination could overcome procedural hurdles and move to a final up-or-down vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://democrats.senate.gov/2013/10/28/cloture-filed-on-6-nominations-estevez-archuleta-wheeler-lew-watt-and-millett/ |title=Cloture filed on 6 nominations-Estevez, Archuleta, Wheeler, Lew, Watt, and Millett |publisher=Democrats.senate.gov |date=October 28, 2013 |accessdate=2013-10-31}}</ref> The motion failed on October 31, with 56 votes in favor, shy of the 60 needed to pass.<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2013/10/31/senate-gop-blocks-mel-watt-nomination/ Washington Post]</ref>

After a series of procedural votes on December 10, 2013, the Senate voted 57-40 to invoke cloture on Watt's nomination, ending the Republican filibuster under the Senate's recently modified rules for cloture on executive branch nominees.<ref>http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=113&session=1&vote=00251</ref>  Later that same day, the Senate confirmed Watt in a 57-41 vote.<ref name="periodicalpress.senate.gov"/>

==Controversies==

===Accusation by Ralph Nader of use of "racial epithet" ===
In 2004, [[Ralph Nader]] attended a meeting with the [[Congressional Black Caucus]], at which Nader clashed with members of the caucus over his presidential bid. After the meeting, Nader alleged that Watt twice uttered an "obscene racial epithet" towards him. It was alleged that Watt said: "You're just another arrogant white man &mdash; telling us what we can do &mdash; it's all about your ego &mdash; another fucking arrogant white man." Although Nader (who is of Lebanese descent) wrote a letter to the Caucus and to Watt asking for an apology, none was offered.<ref>{{cite news|title=Nader Angers Congressional Black Caucus with Demand for Apology|newspaper=The Hill|date=14 July 2004|author=Nichols, Hans|author2=Savodnik, Peter |url=http://www.commondreams.org/headlines04/0714-11.htm}}</ref>

===Opposition to Federal Reserve auditing===
In 2009, fellow congressman [[Ron Paul]] reported to Bloomberg that while Paul's bill [[HR 1207]], which mandates an audit of the [[Federal Reserve]], was in subcommittee, Watt had substantially altered the substance of the bill, a move which had "gutted" the bill's protections.<ref name="bloomberg fed">{{cite news|last=Ivry|first=Bob|title=Federal Reserve Policy Audit Legislation ‘Gutted,’ Paul Says|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=atc2o1ijLRno|accessdate=16 December 2011|newspaper=Bloomberg|date=30 October 2009}}</ref> According to Bloomberg News, on October 20, 2009, "The bill, with 308 co-sponsors, has been stripped of provisions that would remove Fed exemptions from audits of transactions with foreign central banks, monetary policy deliberations, transactions made under the direction of the [[Federal Open Market Committee]] (FOMC) and communications between the Board, the reserve banks and staff, Paul said today." Paul said there is "nothing left" in the bill after Watt's actions.<ref name="bloomberg fed"/>

Paul responded when he and [[Alan Grayson]] of [[Florida]] passed a competing amendment hours before the bill cleared the [[House Financial Services Committee]] to restore the bill's original language and undo Watt's attempts to weaken its effects. Watt won support from Chairman [[Barney Frank]] of [[Massachusetts]] and the [[Congressional Black Caucus]], both of which backed his amendment. Eight of the ten Black Caucus members on the committee voted against the Paul-Grayson amendment. Watt and Frank voted to inhibit the bill's approval. With pressure from the Congressional Black Caucus to delay consideration of the bill by the full House of Representatives, it is unclear when HR 1207 will face a final vote.<ref name="FDL">{{cite web|last=Dayen|first=David|title=Paul-Grayson "Audit The Fed" Bill Passes Financial Services Committee|url=http://news.firedoglake.com/2009/11/19/paul-grayson-audit-the-fed-bill-passes-financial-services-committee/|publisher=Fire Dog Lake|accessdate=16 December 2011|date=19 November 2009}}</ref>

The country's largest bank [[Bank of America]] is headquartered in Charlotte in Watt's congressional district and has threatened to leave. The [[Sunlight Foundation]] reported that 45% of Watt's campaign contributions for 2009 are from corporations in the real estate, insurance and finance industries, the seventh-highest percentage of any member of Congress.<ref name="sunlight watt">{{cite web|last=Blumenthal|first=Paul|title=Chamber of Commerce Deploys Former Government Officials to Lobby On Financial Regulation|url=http://blog.sunlightfoundation.com/2009/10/15/chamber-of-commerce-deploys-former-government-officials-to-lobby-on-financial-regulation/|publisher=Sunlight Foundation|accessdate=17 December 2011|date=15 October 2009}}</ref><ref name="sunlight watt2">{{cite web|last=Blumenthal|first=Paul|title=Top Financial Services Committee Members Rely Heavily On Finance Campaign Contributions|url=http://blog.sunlightfoundation.com/2009/10/09/top-financial-services-committee-members-rely-heavily-on-finance-campaign-contributions/|publisher=Sunlight Foundation|accessdate=17 December 2011|date=9 October 2009}}</ref> Watt’s largest contributors included [[American Express]], [[Wachovia]], Bank of America and the [[American Bankers Association]].<ref name="OPENSECRETS">{{cite web|title=Top 20 Contributors [of] Representative Melvin L.

===Support of SOPA===

Congressman Watt ardently supports the [[Stop Online Piracy Act]], stating that it is "beyond troubling to hear hyperbolic charges that this bill will open the floodgates to government censorship".<ref name="SOPA1">{{cite news|last=McCullagh|first=Declan|title=SOPA bill won't make U.S. a 'repressive regime,' Democrat says|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-31921_3-57325905-281/sopa-bill-wont-make-u.s-a-repressive-regime-democrat-says/|accessdate=17 December 2011|newspaper=CNET.com|date=16 November 2011}}</ref>

===Ethics investigation===
Congressman Watt was formally investigated by the [[Office of Congressional Ethics]] over a series of fundraising events he was involved in. On December 9, 2009 Watt held a fundraiser and soon after withdrew a proposal he had introduced to subject auto dealers to more stringent regulations. The fundraiser brought donors mainly from large finance companies such as [[Goldman Sachs]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Leonnig|first=Carol D.|title=8 House members investigated over fundraisers held near financial reform vote|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/06/15/AR2010061505643.html|accessdate=17 December 2011|newspaper=Washington Post|date=16 June 2010}}</ref> Watt was later cleared of charges or wrongdoing.<ref>{{cite news|last=Morrill|first=Jim|title=Mel Watt cleared by ethics panel|accessdate=17 December 2011|newspaper=Charlotte Observer|date=2 September 2011}} Reprinted at {{url|1=http://www.qcitymetro.com/news/articles/mel_watt_cleared_by_panel070130545.cfm|2=Queen City Metro website}}</ref>

In what the nonpartisan [[Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington]] (CREW) called "disgraceful",<ref>{{cite web|title=Watt's disgraceful attempt to destroy the OCE|url=http://www.citizensforethics.org/blog/c/mel-watt|publisher=Center for Responsible Ethics in Washington|accessdate=17 December 2011}}</ref> Watt introduced legislation to slash funding for the Office of Congressional Ethics.<ref>{{cite news|last=Siegelbaum|first=Debbie|title=Dem seeks to slash funding for ethics office set up by Pelosi|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/house/172909-dem-seeks-to-slash-funding-for-ethics-office-set-up-by-pelosi|accessdate=17 December 2011|newspaper=The Hill|date=21 July 2011}}</ref>

===Racial gerrymandering===
In 1993, the design of his district was challenged as an instance of racial [[gerrymandering]]. The Supreme Court held in ''[[Shaw v. Reno]]'' that the unusual shape of the district required strict scrutiny of its racial purpose. Although it is rare for a law to survive strict scrutiny, the districting plan was upheld on remand as "narrowly tailored to further the state's compelling interest in complying with the [[Voting Rights Act]]".<ref>{{cite news|title=U.S. Panel in North Carolina Calls Racial Gerrymandering Legal|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/02/us/us-panel-in-north-carolina-calls-racial-gerrymandering-legal.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=2 August 1994}}</ref>

==Political campaigns==
In 1992, Watt was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives from North Carolina's newly created 12th Congressional District and became one of only two [[African American]] members elected to Congress from North Carolina in the 20th century, the other being [[Eva M. Clayton]].
