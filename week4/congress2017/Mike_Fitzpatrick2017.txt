'''Michael G. "Mike" Fitzpatrick''' (born June 28, 1963) is a lawyer and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]  member of the [[United States House of Representatives]], representing {{ushr|PA|8}}. He was first elected to Congress in 2004 and represented the district from 2005 to 2007, but he was defeated by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Patrick Murphy (Pennsylvania politician)|Patrick Murphy]] in 2006.

He declined to challenge Murphy in 2008 but ran again in 2010, and reclaimed the seat from Murphy. He was re-elected in 2012 and 2014. A supporter of [[Term limits in the United States|term limits]], he will be retiring in 2016. He maintained a moderate conservative position, and consistently ranked among the most bipartisan members of Congress.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thelugarcenter.org/ourwork-Bipartisan-Index.html|title=Our Work: The Lugar Center|website=thelugarcenter.org|accessdate=2016-08-22}}</ref>

==Early life, education and law career==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=November 2016}}
Fitzpatrick was born and raised in [[Bucks County, Pennsylvania|Bucks County]]. He graduated from [[Bishop Egan High School]], now Conwell-Egan Catholic High School, in [[Fairless Hills, Pennsylvania|Fairless Hills]]. He moved to Florida to attend [[St. Thomas University (Florida)|St. Thomas University]] with an academic scholarship where he earned his bachelor's degree in 1985 from the school's honors program.

He earned his law degree from the [[Dickinson School of Law]] at [[Pennsylvania State University|Penn State University]]. He was named business manager of the Dickinson Journal of International Law. After graduating law school in 1988, Fitzpatrick was admitted to the practice of law in Pennsylvania and New Jersey.

==Bucks County Commission (1995–2005)==
In January 1995, Fitzpatrick was appointed to the [[Bucks County, Pennsylvania#Politics|Bucks County Board of Commissioners]] by an 11-member panel of [[Bucks County, Pennsylvania|county]] judges. The appointment was made to fill the unexpired term of [[Mark Schweiker]], who had been elected [[Lieutenant Governor of Pennsylvania|lieutenant governor]].

Fitzpatrick, who was an attorney at a firm active in county affairs, was the candidate preferred by county Republican Party leaders.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=PI&s_site=philly&p_multi=PI&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB32B72F34573A2&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|title=Philadelphia Inquirer: Search Results|work=newsbank.com|accessdate=May 13, 2015|date=January 12, 1995}}</ref>

The appointment was not without controversy, however, as some claimed the judges had acted solely on the recommendation of the county Republican Party.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/mcall/access/92630225.html?dids=92630225:92630225&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Jan+21%2C+1995&author=LESLIE+KLEIN+FUNK%2C+The+Morning+Call&pub=Morning+Call&desc=BUCKS+CANDIDATE+BLASTS+JUDGES+COMMISSIONER+HOPEFUL+SAYS+11+JURISTS+BLINDLY+CHOSE+RIVAL&pqatl=google|title=Archives: Allentown Morning Call - BUCKS CANDIDATE BLASTS JUDGES COMMISSIONER HOPEFUL SAYS 11 JURISTS BLINDLY CHOSE RIVAL|work=pqarchiver.com|accessdate=13 May 2015|date=January 21, 1995}}</ref>

As Commissioner, Fitzpatrick oversaw social agencies, coordinated the response of local governments to emergencies, preserved open space, and responded to regional issues. Fitzpatrick supported a $7 million information-technology project to upgrade the county's communication and outreach abilities in light of the [[Information Age]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.philly.com/1999-10-27/news/25508217_1_gop-pair-michael-g-fitzpatrick-open-space|title=Bucks Race Hinges On Land Use Both Sides Cite Open Space As A Key Issue In The Campaign For County Commissioner.

==U.S. House of Representatives (2005–2007)==

===Elections===
;2004
In July 2004, popular moderate Republican [[James C. Greenwood]] unexpectedly withdrew from his re-election campaign. In the party convention held to select Greenwood's replacement on the ballot, the more conservative Fitzpatrick won the nomination over Greenwood's choice, state Senator [[Joe Conti]], thanks to the backing of Bucks County Republican Party boss Harry Fawkes. Fitzpatrick went on to face liberal activist Virginia Schrader in the general election.<ref>[http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=12535985&BRD=1685&PAG=461&dept_id=45363&rfi=6 Doylestown Patriot \–- Schrader responds to Greenwood's retirement], zwire.com; accessed November 10, 2016.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/2006/house/?state=PA|title=Larry J.

;2006
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Pennsylvania, 2006#8th Congressional district}}
Fitzpatrick faced Democrat [[Patrick Murphy (Pennsylvania politician)|Patrick Murphy]] in the November general election of 2006. In January 2006, Fitzpatrick said he had donated to charity the $21,500 he received from political action committees headed by U.S. Representatives [[Bob Ney]] (R-OH), [[Tom DeLay]], (R-TX), and [[Randy Cunningham|Randy "Duke" Cunningham]] (R-CA).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phillyburbs.com/pb-dyn/news/111-01222006-601349.html|title=Archived copy|accessdate=2006-10-27|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061118083425/http://www.phillyburbs.com:80/pb-dyn/news/111-01222006-601349.html|archivedate=2006-11-18}}</ref>

Fitzpatrick was endorsed by several environmental groups including the [[Sierra Club]]. He was the only incumbent Republican congressman in Pennsylvania who had the support of the environmentalist lobby during this election. The ''[[Cook Political Report]]'' rated the race as "Leans Republican". However, [[Congressional Quarterly]] pegged the contest as a "Toss-up". A poll released at the end of October showed Fitzpatrick trailing Murphy by three percentage points.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://electioncentral.tpmcafe.com/election_tags/pa_08|title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-10-31|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061010232130/http://electioncentral.tpmcafe.com:80/election_tags/pa_08|archivedate=2006-10-10}}</ref>

In the end, the election was decided by less than one percentage point, with Fitzpatrick initially trailing by just over 1,500 votes out of nearly 250,000 cast. On November 8, with all precincts reporting, Murphy led by 1,521 votes. Philadelphia television station NBC 10 later reported that Fitzpatrick had conceded the election to Murphy.<ref>NBC10.com.

==Tenure==
In May 2006, Fitzpatrick introduced the [[Deleting Online Predators Act of 2006]], which requires most schools and libraries to actively restrict minors from access to "Commercial Social Networking Websites" and "Chat Rooms". In late July, the "DOPA Act" overwhelmingly passed the House. Speaking before the vote was taken, Fitzpatrick said, "The social networking sites have become, in a sense, a happy hunting ground for child predators".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/5230506.stm|work=BBC News|title=Social network sites face US ban|date=July 31, 2006|accessdate=May 12, 2010}}</ref>

==Committee assignments==
Fitzpatrick served on the [[United States House Committee on Financial Services]] and the [[United States House Committee on Small Business]].

==Inter-Congressional career (2007–2011)==
After the loss to Murphy, Fitzpatrick re-entered the practice of law, taking a position with Middletown Township law firm—and major Republican Party contributor<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aboveavgjane.blogspot.com/2006/07/mike-fitzpatricks-political-origins.html|title=Above Average Jane|work=aboveavgjane.blogspot.com|accessdate=13 May 2015}}</ref>—Begley, Carlin, and Mandio.<ref>[http://www.begleycarlin.com/Bio/MichaelFitzpatrick.asp Profile], begleycarlin.com; accessed November 10, 2016.</ref><ref>[http://www.phillyburbs.com/pb-dyn/news/113-12242007-1461181.html Pay to play not a given in Bucks], phillyBurbs.com; accessed November 10, 2016.</ref>

In the fall of 2007, the Bucks County Commissioners asked Fitzpatrick, along with former Commissioner [[Andy Warren (politician)|Andy Warren]] and former Common Pleas Judge [[William Hart Rufe]] to co-chair an effort to pass a ballot initiative authorizing the county to borrow $87 million for open space preservation.<ref>[http://www.phillyburbs.com/pb-dyn/news/281-08152007-1392945.html Big push for open space support], phillyBurbs.com; accessed November 10, 2016.</ref>  The initiative, which was also endorsed by Congressman Murphy, passed by a large margin.

;2008
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Pennsylvania, 2008#8th Congressional district}}
Throughout 2007, there was much speculation that Fitzpatrick would seek to reclaim the seat in Congress that he lost to Murphy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.mcall.com/penn_ave/2007/09/add-a-name-to-t.html|title=Mcall.com: Pennsylvania Ave. Blog|work=mcall.com|accessdate=May 13, 2015}}</ref> Fitzpatrick laid the rumors to rest in January 2008 by announcing that he would not be running for Congress, but instead would challenge freshman State Representative [[Chris King (politician)|Chris King]] in the [[Pennsylvania House of Representatives, District 142|142nd District]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Despite charges by some Democrats that he was "afraid to run against Murphy because he knows he would lose", Fitzpatrick claimed that he was interested in the job because of his "passion ... in solving local problems and serving the local community", as well as a desire to "change the way business is done in Harrisburg."<ref>[http://www.phillyburbs.com/pb-dyn/news/111-01212008-1474906.html Fitzpatrick to run for state House], phillyBurbs.com; accessed November 10, 2016.</ref>

However, a cancer diagnosis forced Fitzpatrick to end his bid for the State House in early February.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} Fitzpatrick yielded his spot on the ballot to Republican activist [[Frank Farry]] (who went on to win the seat), and supported [[Doylestown Township, Pennsylvania|Doylestown]] pharmaceutical company executive [[Thomas Manion]] for the congressional seat he once held.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

He described [[Washington, D.C.]] as "a town of embedded politicians" with a seniority system that "rewards congressmen for political careers lasting decades and encourages members to serve in perpetuity." He called for "real reform of house rules and procedures" and "congressional term limits."<ref name=fourterms>{{cite web|url=http://www.buckslocalnews.com/articles/2010/02/08/bucks_news/doc4b6b2349acb3c896091342.txt|title=Fitzpatrick pledges to limit himself to four terms|publisher=Bucks Local News|date=February 8, 2010|accessdate=November 11, 2014}}</ref>

On January 5, 2011, Fitzpatrick failed to attend the swearing-in ceremony for members {{Why|date=November 2016}} and attempted to take the oath-of-office remotely at a reception.<ref name="swearingin">{{cite web|url=http://www.montgomerynews.com/articles/2011/01/15/perkasie_news_herald/news/doc4d30d9886faf3245824835.txt|title=Bucks Congressman Mike Fitzpatrick faces ethics complaint over swearing-in snafu|work=Montgomery Media|date=January 15, 2011}}</ref> However, House rules require that the oath be taken within proximity of the Speaker.<ref name="swearingin"/> The oath was administered the following day, but two votes that he cast prior to taking the oath were nullified according to the Constitution.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/nation/index.ssf/2011/01/house_nullifies_votes_by_2_rep.html|title=House nullifies votes by 2 representatives who skipped swearing-in|work=Cleveland.com|date=January 8, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/44/2011/01/votes-of-gop-lawmakers-who-mis.html|title=Votes for GOP members who missed oath ruled invalid|work=Washingtonpost.com|date=January 6, 2011}}</ref>

Some congressional ethics experts contend the reception was a fundraiser and called for an investigation by the [[House Ethics Committee]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/01/07/did-rep-who-skipped-swear_n_805904.html|title=Did Rep Who Skipped Swearing In For Fundraiser Break The Law?|work=huffingtonpost.com|date=January 7, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mcall.com/news/nationworld/pennsylvania/mc-dc-congressman-fitzpatrick-ethics-20110107,0,6435857.story|title=More trouble for Fitzpatrick?|work=www.mcall.com|date=January 7, 2011}}</ref>

Since December 2014, Fitzpatrick has been a leading voice in Congress on medical device safety.
