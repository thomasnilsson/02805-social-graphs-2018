==Early life, education, and military service==
Born in [[Brooklyn, New York|Brooklyn]] to Lewis Owens and Alice Stanton Owens,<ref name="alice"/> Owens was raised in [[Mineola, New York]]. After graduating from [[Chaminade High School]], where he was a classmate of television host and conservative political commentator [[Bill O'Reilly (political commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]], he enlisted in the [[U.S. Air Force]] and was stationed at [[Plattsburgh Air Force Base]]. He returned to the North Country and has lived there for over 30 years after serving as a [[United States Air Force]] captain.

Owens is a 1971 [[summa cum laude]] graduate of [[Manhattan College]] with a degree in [[business administration]] and a 1974 top-half graduate of [[Fordham University School of Law]].

==Law career==
Before coming to Congress, Owens was a managing partner at Stafford, Owens, Piller, Murnane & Trombley, where he specialized in business law, international law, and estate and tax law.<ref name="soct law"/> He is also an adjunct professor in business law at [[State University of New York at Plattsburgh]]. In 2004, he was appointed by Governor [[George Pataki]] to the College Council at that university.<ref name="appointed"/> He served as the host for Business Affairs<ref name="progamming"/><ref name="hat into ring"/> on [[WCFE-TV]], a [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS television station]] in Plattsburgh.

===Elections===
;2009
{{Main article|New York's 23rd congressional district special election, 2009}}
On August 10, 2009, the Democratic Party of [[New York's 23rd congressional district]] chose Owens to run in [[New York's 23rd congressional district special election, 2009|a special election]] to fill the House seat vacated by the incumbent Republican [[John M. McHugh|John McHugh]], who had resigned to take a post as the [[Secretary of the Army]].<ref name="democrats nominate"/> Because he was a registered independent at the time, Owens had to obtain the signatures of all 11 Democratic county chairs in the district to allow him to run as a Democrat.<ref name="Observer"/>

Originally, Owens faced Republican [[New York State Assembly|Assemblywoman]] [[Dierdre Scozzafava|Dede Scozzafava]] and [[Doug Hoffman]], an accountant from [[Lake Placid, New York|Lake Placid]] who was running as a third party candidate on the single ballot line of the [[Conservative Party of New York]] after failing to also get the Republican Party nomination. “The race,” wrote Valerie Bauman of the Associated Press, “received national attention, with some calling it a referendum on Obama and others saying it could help Republicans focus their message to attract more people to the party.”  Bauman said that “Despite the fervor that surrounded Hoffman in the final week of the campaign, Owens managed to appeal to the voters with his talk of job creation and the need for more federal support for Fort Drum (an army base in the district) and farmers.”<ref name="NY 23">{{cite news|last=Bauman|first=Valerie|title=NY 23 Election Results: Bill Owens Beats Doug Hoffman|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/11/03/bill-owens-leads-doug-hof_n_344776.html|work=Huffington Post|date=November 4, 2009}}</ref> Scozzafava was a social liberal, and high-profile conservatives such as [[Rush Limbaugh]], [[Sarah Palin]], and [[Michelle Malkin]] threw their support behind Hoffman, who enjoyed Tea Party support. Under pressure from conservative elements in her party, who saw “Doug Hoffman as the man who would save them,” according to the ''San Francisco Chronicle'', Scozzafava dropped out of the race on October 31, the weekend before the election.<ref name="Election results">{{cite news|title=Election results|url=http://blog.sfgate.com/abraham/2009/11/03/ny-23-election-results-bill-owens-beats-doug-hoffman-glenn-beck-and-rush- limbaugh/|newspaper=SF gate}}</ref> Hoffman became Owens's sole opponent when Scozzafava dropped out of the race on October 31. The ''Watertown Daily Times'', which had originally endorsed Scozzafava, switched its endorsement to Owens on November 1.<ref name="changed race"/> Later on November 1, Scozzafava endorsed Owens.  In the special election, Owens won 49 percent of the vote to 45 percent for Hoffman and 6 percent for Scozzafava. Owens was sworn in on November 6, 2009.  He became the first Democrat to represent what is now the 23rd since 1873.

;2010
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in New York, 2010#District 23}}

Owens almost immediately announced that he would run for a full term in 2010.  He campaigned largely on “creating jobs throughout his district, attracting foreign manufacturers, taking care of veterans, and ensuring that Fort Drum (an Army installation located in the district) is preserved.” Owens won his re-election bid with a second consecutive [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] of 47.5% of the vote against Republican and Independence nominee [[Matt Doheny]] and Conservative nominee Doug Hoffman, becoming the first Democrat to win a full term in the North Country district in 138 years.

The election was one of the ten closest Congressional races that year.<ref name=NCN>{{cite news|title=$200,000 Attacking Owens|url=http://northcountrynow.com/news/gop-congressional-candidate-doheny-says-outside-groups-have-already-spent-200000-attacking-incu|newspaper=North County Now|date=December 29, 2011}}</ref>

During his campaign, Owens said he would focus on creating jobs throughout his district, attracting foreign manufacturers, taking care of veterans, and ensuring that [[Fort Drum]] is preserved.<ref name="Observer" /><ref name="wptz"/> He has called for deeper federal budget cuts (including 3% cuts across the board for federal agencies), co-sponsored the Budget Process Improvement Act of 2011, and said that the Bush-era tax cuts need to be allowed to expire for people earning over $500,000. Owens is the second thriftiest member of Congress, with staff expenses of $713,969.<ref name=frugal>{{cite news|title=Frelinghuysen’s staff most frugal|url=http://newjerseyhills.com/bernardsville_news/news/frelinghuysen-s-staff-most-frugal/article_d0c22ea4- b79b-11e0-914b-001cc4c03286.html|newspaper=The Bernardsville News|date=August 19, 2011}}</ref>

Owens has consistently voted for legislation to build the controversial [[Keystone Pipeline]] to carry tar sand oil across the United States from Canada for export to foreign nations .<ref>OWENS Press Release January 8, 2012 : 113th Congress HR 3</ref>

On December 14, 2011, Marc Heller reported that Sen. [[Claire McCaskill]] had accused Owens and other members of the House Armed Services Committee “of loading up an annual defense bill with pork-barrel projects despite a congressional ban on home-state 'earmarks.'” Owens's earmarks “included construction at Fort Drum and $500,000 intended for the Fort Drum Regional Health Planning Organization.”<ref name=PorkBarrel>{{cite news|title=Senator Accuses Owens Of PorkBarrel Projects|url=http://www.ogd.com/article/20111214/OGD01/312149992/-1/ogd01|newspaper=The Journal|date=December 14, 2011}}</ref>
