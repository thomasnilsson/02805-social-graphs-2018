==Early life and education==
Lee was born '''Barbara Jean Tutt''' in [[El Paso, Texas]], the daughter of Mildred Adaire (née Parish) and Garvin Alexander Tutt, a Lieutenant Colonel.<ref>{{cite web|title=Barbara Lee|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~battle/reps/leebarbara.htm|website=Ancestry|accessdate=1 October 2014}}</ref> According to a DNA analysis, she descends primarily from the people of [[Guinea-Bissau]] and [[Sierra Leone]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2008/11/prweb1673564.htm|title=Growing Interest in DNA-Based Genetic Testing Among African American with Historic Election of President Elect Barack Obama|date=27 November 2008|work=PRWeb|accessdate=11 December 2014}}</ref><ref>{{YouTube|8SSC1rS6B8E|Congresswoman Barbara Lee Ancestry Reveal}}</ref> She moved from [[Texas]] to [[California]] in 1960 with her military family parents, and attended [[San Fernando High School]] in the [[Pacoima, Los Angeles|Pacoima]] neighborhood of [[Los Angeles]].<ref name=tavis_smiley_20081113>{{Cite web | first= | last=Interview Transcript | url=http://www.pbs.org/wnet/tavissmiley/archive/200811/20081113_lee.html | title=Rep.

==Political career==
While a student at Mills College, she was a volunteer at the Oakland chapter of the [[Black Panther Party]]'s Community Learning Center and worked on Panther co-founder [[Bobby Seale]]'s 1973 Oakland mayoral campaign.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mindfully.org/Reform/2006/Black-Panthers-Led8oct06.htm|title=A Legacy of Activism: Behind Fury, Black Panthers Laid Course for Social Programs WILLIAM BRAND & CECILY BURT / Oakland Tribune 8oct2006|publisher=Mindfully.org|accessdate=11 December 2014}}</ref> Lee was a staff member for United States Representative [[Ron Dellums]] and a member of the [[California State Assembly]] and the [[California State Senate]] before entering the House. She ran for Congress in a [[special election]] that created a year-long series of five special elections as various East Bay politicians vied for political office. (For a detailed account of these elections, see [[Special election musical chairs]].)

===AUMF opposition===
Lee gained national attention in 2001 as the only member of congress to vote "No" on the [[Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists]] (AUMF), stating that she voted no not because she opposed military action but because she believed the AUMF, as written, granted overly-broad powers to wage war to the president at a time when the facts regarding the situation were not yet clear. She "warned her colleagues to be 'careful not to embark on an open-ended war with neither an exit strategy nor a focused target.'"<ref>Polner, Murray (2010-03-01) [http://www.amconmag.com/article/2010/mar/01/00032/ Left Behind], ''[[The American Conservative]]''</ref> Lee explained, "It was a blank check to the president to attack anyone involved in the September 11 events—anywhere, in any country, without regard to our nation's long-term foreign policy, economic and national security interests, and without time limit. In granting these overly broad powers, the Congress failed its responsibility to understand the dimensions of its declaration.... The president has the constitutional authority to protect the nation from further attack, and he has mobilized the armed forces to do just that. The Congress should have waited for the facts to be presented and then acted with fuller knowledge of the consequences of our action."

This vote made nationwide news reports and brought about a large and extremely polarized response, with the volume of calls gridlocking the switchboard of her Capitol Hill office. Although it appears to have reflected the beliefs of the majority of her constituents, the majority of responses from elsewhere in the nation were angry and hostile, some referring to her as "communist" and "traitor". Many of the responses included death threats against her or her family to the point that the Capitol Police provided round-the-clock plainclothes bodyguards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2001/09/23/INLEE.DTL|title=Why I opposed the resolution to authorize force|work=SFGate|accessdate=11 December 2014}}</ref> She was also criticized by politicians and in editorial pages of conservative-leaning newspapers, e.g. [[John Fund]]'s column in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]].''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opinionjournal.com/diary/?id=95001156|title=Opinion, Editorials, Columns, Op-Ed, Letters to the Editor, Commentary - Wall Street Journal - Wsj.com|publisher=Opinionjournal.com|accessdate=11 December 2014}}</ref> She was awarded the Seán MacBride Peace Prize by the [[International Peace Bureau]] in 2002 for that vote.

In her speech, she quoted the Rev. [[Nathan Baxter]], dean of [[National Cathedral]]: “As we act, let us not become the evil that we deplore."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2009/9/16/let_us_not_become_the_evil_we_deplore|title="Let Us Not Become the Evil We Deplore."
