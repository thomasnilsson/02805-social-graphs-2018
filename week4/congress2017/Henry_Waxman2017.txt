'''Henry Arnold Waxman''' (born September 12, 1939) is an American politician who served as the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|CA|33}} from 1975 until 2015. Waxman is a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. His district included much of the western part of the city of [[Los Angeles]], as well as [[West Hollywood]], [[Santa Monica]] and [[Beverly Hills]], and was numbered the [[California's 24th congressional district|24th district]] from 1975 to 1993, the [[California's 29th congressional district|29th district]] from 1993 to 2003, and the [[California's 30th congressional district|30th district]] from 2003 to 2013, changing due to [[redistricting]] after the [[1990 United States Census|1990]], [[2000 United States Census|2000]] and [[2010 United States Census|2010]] censuses. He now serves as Chairman at Waxman Strategies, a DC-based communications and lobbying firm, working on issues like health care, environment, energy, technology and telecommunications.<ref>{{cite news |author=Mario Trujillo |date=9 June 2015 |title=Former Rep.

Waxman was considered to be one of the most influential [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] members of [[United States Congress|Congress]] and was instrumental in passing laws including the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act#Significant amendments and related laws|Infant Formula Act]] of 1980, the [[Orphan Drug Act of 1983|Orphan Drug Act]] of 1983, the [[Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act]] of 1984, the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] of 1990, the [[Ryan White CARE Act]] of 1990, the [[Food Quality Protection Act]] of 1996, the [[State Children's Health Insurance Program]] of 1997, the [[Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act]] of 2006, the [[Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act]] of 2009 and the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] of 2010.<ref name=keyforce>{{cite news|author=Jonathan Wiseman|title=Henry Waxman, Key Democrat and Force for Health Care Law, Is to Retire|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/31/us/politics/henry-a-waxman-a-house-democratic-fixture-will-retire.html|accessdate=February 14, 2014|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=January 30, 2014}}</ref><ref name=toretire>{{cite news |author=Karen Tumulty |author-link=Karen Tumulty |date=January 30, 2014 |title=Henry Waxman to retire at end of congressional session |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/henry-waxman-to-retire/2014/01/30/c06485fa-892d-11e3-833c-33098f9e5267_story.html |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |accessdate=February 14, 2014}}</ref><ref name=hero>{{cite news|author=Jonathan Cohn|title=Farewell to Henry Waxman, a Liberal Hero|url=http://www.newrepublic.com/article/116418/henry-waxman-retiring-heres-why-well-miss-him|accessdate=February 14, 2014|newspaper=[[The New Republic]]|date=January 31, 2014}}</ref> He served as Chairman of the [[United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform|House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform]] from 2007 to 2009, Chairman of the [[United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce|House Committee on Energy and Commerce]] from 2009 to 2011 and was the ranking member of the Energy and Commerce Committee from 2011 until 2015. On January 30, 2014, Waxman announced he would not seek re-election to a 21st term [[United States House of Representatives elections in California, 2014|in 2014]]. State senator [[Ted Lieu]] defeated district attorney [[Elan Carr]] in the midterm election on November 4, 2014, and succeeded Waxman on January 3, 2015.<ref name=manybills>{{cite news|last=DeLong|first=Matt|title=Henry Waxman: A man of many bills|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2014/01/30/henry-waxman-a-man-of-many-bills/|accessdate=30 January 2014|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=January 30, 2014}}</ref>

==Early life, education, and early career==
Waxman was born in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], the son of Esther (née Silverman) and Ralph Louis Waxman. His father was born in Montreal, Canada, and his mother was from Pennsylvania; all of his grandparents were Jewish immigrants from [[Russia]].<ref>http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~battle/reps/waxman.htm</ref> He attended college at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]], earning a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[political science]] in 1961 and a [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] degree from [[UCLA School of Law|UCLA's law school]] in 1964. After graduating, he worked as a lawyer. He was elected to the [[California Assembly]] in 1969 and served three terms. Along with Congressman [[Howard Berman]], Waxman co-founded the [[Los Angeles County Young Democrats]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Lowenfeld|first1=Jonah|title=California’s new citizen-led redistricting panel could force two Jewish Democrats into a face-off|url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/los_angeles/article/californias_new_citizen-led_redistricting_panel_could_force_two_jewish_demo|accessdate=21 August 2014|publisher=Jewish Journal|date=2011-07-19}}</ref>

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
In 1974, Democratic congressman [[Chet Holifield]] retired after 16 terms in Congress.  Waxman gave up his state assembly seat to run for the district, which had been renumbered from the 19th to the 24th in a mid-decade redistricting. Waxman won the Democratic nomination for the district, and easily won the general election, as this was [[tantamount to election]] in this heavily Democratic district. He has been re-elected 17 times with no substantive opposition. He faced no major-party opposition in 1986, and was completely unopposed in 2008. His district has changed numbers four times in his tenure—from the 24th (1975–1993) to the 29th (1993–2003) to the 30th (2003–2012) to the 33rd (2012). He was one of the last two members, along with [[George Miller (California politician)|George Miller]] of California, of the large Democratic freshman class of 1975.

Waxman's most recent district (until 2012), [[California's 30th congressional district]], included [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]], [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]], [[Agoura Hills, California|Agoura Hills]], [[Calabasas, California|Calabasas]], [[Hidden Hills, California|Hidden Hills]], [[Malibu, California|Malibu]], [[West Hollywood, California|West Hollywood]], and [[Westlake Village, California|Westlake Village]] as well as such areas of western Los Angeles as [[West Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California|West Los Angeles]], [[Fairfax District, Los Angeles, California|Fairfax]], [[Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles, California|Pacific Palisades]], [[Brentwood, Los Angeles, California|Brentwood]], [[Beverlywood, Los Angeles, California|Beverlywood]], [[Topanga, California|Topanga]], [[Chatsworth, Los Angeles, California|Chatsworth]], [[Palms, Los Angeles, California|Palms]], [[Westwood, Los Angeles, California|Westwood]], [[West Hills, Los Angeles, California|West Hills]], [[Westside Village, Los Angeles, California|Westside Village]], [[Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, California|Woodland Hills]], but through the creation of a new 33rd Congressional District by the California Citizens Redistricting Commission, in the November 2012 general election Waxman won re-election<ref name="2012election">http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/house-races/266603-waxman-fights-off-independent-opponent</ref> in an area including his home community of Beverly Hills and stretching to Malibu and Pacific-coastal communities heading south including Santa Monica, Manhattan Beach, Redondo Beach, Hermosa Beach, the Palos Verdes Peninsula and Northwest San Pedro.<ref>{{cite news|last=Marroquin|first=Art|title=House veteran Waxman will run in new district that includes South Bay|url=http://www.dailybreeze.com/news/ci_18774324|newspaper=The Daily Breeze|date=29 August 2011}}</ref>

===Tenure===
Before the Democrats lost control of the House of Representatives in 1995, Waxman was a powerful figure in the House as chair of the [[United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce#Subcommittees|Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health and the Environment]] from 1979. In this role he conducted investigations into a range of health and environmental issues, including universal health insurance, [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Medicaid]] coverage, [[AIDS]] and air and water pollution.  In 1994, Waxman forced the chief executives of the seven major tobacco companies to swear under oath that [[nicotine]] was not addictive.<ref name="1994 Tobacco Transcript">{{cite web|title=Inside the Tobacco Deal|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/settlement/timelines/april94.html|work=Frontline|publisher=PBS|accessdate=20 July 2012}}</ref>

Waxman's stated legislative priorities are health and environmental issues. These include universal health insurance, Medicare and Medicaid coverage, tobacco, AIDS, air and water quality standards, pesticides, nursing home quality standards, women's health research and reproductive rights, the availability and cost of prescription drugs, and the right of communities to know about pollution levels.  As an example of Waxman's thoughts regarding tobacco, on April 13, 2010, he requested that [[Major League Baseball]] ban smokeless tobacco in all its various forms - [[Snuff (tobacco)|snuff]], [[dipping tobacco]]. [[chewing tobacco]], [[snus]], etc.<ref>{{cite journal |date=April 26, 2010 |title=For the Record: Requested |journal=[[Sports Illustrated]] |volume=112 |issue=18 |page=16 |publisher=[[Time Inc.|Time]] |editor1-first=Terry |editor1-last=McDonell |editor1-link=Terry McDonell }}</ref>

With the Democrats' victory in the [[U.S. House election, 2006|2006 midterm elections]], Waxman became chairman of the [[United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform|House Oversight and Government Reform Committee]], the principal investigative committee of the House. He was the committee's ranking Democrat from 1997 to 2007.  In 1998, while he was still ranking member, he created a "Special Investigations Division" to investigate matters that he felt the full committee had neglected. This was possible because the committee has broad powers to investigate any matter with federal policy implications, even if another committee has jurisdiction over it.<ref>{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051215014917/www.democrats.reform.house.gov/investigations.asp |date=December 15, 2005 |title=Special Investigations }}. democrats.reform.house.gov. Retrieved on 2011-11-22.</ref> He has also harshly criticized the Republicans for ignoring their "constitutional responsibility" to conduct oversight over the government.<ref>{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051226041215/reform.democrats.house.gov/story.asp?id=706 |date=December 26, 2005 |title=Committee on Government Reform Minority Office }}. democrats.reform.house.gov. Retrieved on 2011-11-22.</ref>

On March 16, 2004, at Waxman's request, the Committee on Government Reform Minority Office published "Iraq on the Record, the Bush Administration's Public Statements on Iraq"<ref>Henry A. Waxman {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070813022744/http://oversight.house.gov/IraqOnTheRecord/ |date=August 13, 2007 |title=Iraq on the Record }}. oversight.house.gov</ref> a detailed and searchable collection of 237 specific misleading statements made by Bush Administration officials about the threat posed by Iraq. It contains statements that were misleading based on what was known to the Administration at the time the statements were made. It does not include statements that appear mistaken only in hindsight. If a statement was an accurate reflection of U.S. intelligence at the time it was made, it was excluded even if it now appears erroneous.

In 2006, Project On Government Oversight, a government watchdog group, presented Waxman with its Good Government Award for his various contributions to government transparency and oversight.<ref>[http://www.pogo.org/honorees/good-government-award/ Good Government Award Home Page.] Project On Government Oversight Website. Retrieved July 1, 2010.</ref>

On the day after the 2006 elections, Waxman directed his aides to draw up an "oversight plan" for the panel. He had already let it be known that he wanted to investigate [[Halliburton]], as well as its alleged malfeasance related to government contracts in [[Iraq]]. It is very likely that he could also investigate the numerous scandals surrounding [[Jack Abramoff]]. This led to concerns among Democratic aides that the Government Reform Committee under Waxman would stage a repeat of the committee's performance under the [[Clinton administration]], when it issued over 1,000 subpoenas. However, Waxman told ''[[Newsweek]]'' that he is interested in accountability and not retaliation.<ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15675859/site/newsweek/page/3/ Democrats’ Challenge: Stay in the Center – Newsweek National News – MSNBC.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061129231512/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15675859/site/newsweek/page/3/ |date=November 29, 2006 }}</ref>

In 2009, he began serving as the Chairman of the [[United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce|House Energy and Commerce Committee]] after defeating Chairman [[John Dingell]] in a 137–122 secret vote of House Democrats on November 20, 2008.

Senator [[Alan K. Simpson|Alan Simpson]] of Wyoming once described Waxman as being 'tougher than a boiled owl'.<ref>{{cite book |title=2014 Almanac of American Politics |last2=McCutcheon |first2=Chuck |last1=Barone|first1=Michael |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |year= 2013}}</ref>

Waxman is proud of his "strong Jewish identity" and has drawn political conclusions from his exploration of the religion.<ref name=trojanWaxman /> "Judaism is about acting and doing the right thing, not simply believing in it or mindlessly following ritual", he said in a speech presented by the [[University of Southern California]]'s Casden Institute for the Study of the Jewish Role in American Life.<ref name=trojanWaxman>{{cite news

He further said that the "Jewish values" of "human rights, social justice, and equal opportunities ... are synonymous with American values", and that such values "are in my opinion closer to a Democratic position." Waxman supported fellow representative [[Jane Harman]] during her primary challenge from Marcy Winograd when Winograd said she would support a one-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, instead of the two-state resolution endorsed by Waxman and Harman. Saying it suffers from "a culture of corruption" and "has become obsessed with secrecy," he accused the [[federal government of the United States|American government]] of having abandoned these values. "(The) Republican leadership ignores presidential rules and norms and has no consideration for custom," he said.<ref>{{cite news|last=Meier |first=Gretchen |title=Congressman lambastes Bush, Republicans on ethical issues |url=http://media.www.dailytrojan.com/media/storage/paper679/news/2006/04/24/News/Congressman.Lambastes.Bush.Republicans.On.Ethical.Issues-1866412.shtml |accessdate=7 November 2012 |newspaper=Daily Trojan |date=2006-04-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827163121/http://media.www.dailytrojan.com/media/storage/paper679/news/2006/04/24/News/Congressman.Lambastes.Bush.Republicans.On.Ethical.Issues-1866412.shtml |archivedate=August 27, 2008 }}</ref>

;Abortion
Waxman was strongly critical of the [[Stupak-Pitts Amendment]], which places limits on taxpayer-funded abortions in the context of the November 2009 [[Affordable Health Care for America Act]]. Instead of this version, it was reported that many Democrats supported a version that would find "common ground."<ref name="Public Plan Abortion">{{cite news|last=McCormack|first=John|title=Waxman Strong-arms Vote to Allow Abortion Coverage in Public Plan|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/weblogs/TWSFP/2009/07/house_democrat_introduces_comp.asp|accessdate=30 August 2012|newspaper=The Weekly Standard|date=31 July 2009}}</ref>

;1985 subway opposition
In 1985, Waxman sponsored a bill supported by affluent [[NIMBY|homeowners groups]] in his district to ban federal funding for the [[LACMTA Red Line|Red Line]] subway after a [[methane gas]] explosion in the [[Fairfax District, Los Angeles, California|Fairfax District]]. In 2005, a robust [[real estate]] market, multi-dwelling construction boom, and lack of public mass transit planning on the westside caused by Waxman's bill resulted in gridlock throughout Waxman's district.<ref>Christine Pelisek [http://www.laweekly.com/2005-03-03/news/red-line-to-somewhere/ Red Line to Somewhere], LA Weekly, 3 March 2005</ref> At the request of Los Angeles Mayor and [[LACMTA]] Board President [[Antonio Villaraigosa]], Waxman agreed to lift the ban if a panel of five engineers found tunneling under the [[Miracle Mile, Los Angeles, California|Miracle Mile]] stretch of Wilshire Boulevard to be safe. In October 2005, the panel decided that tunneling was possible, and on December 16, Waxman responded by announcing he would introduce a bill to the U.S. House that would lift the ban on federal money for subway tunneling in the district. This bill passed the House via unanimous vote on September 20, 2006.<ref>{{cite news |date=20 September 2006 |title=In boost to LA subway extension, House lifts tunneling ban |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2006/09/20/state/n171847D35.DTL&type=politics |newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |agency=Associated Press |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224191253/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2006/09/20/state/n171847D35.DTL&type=politics |archive-date=24 December 2007}}</ref>

Waxman maintains that the 1985 bill was sponsored in the interest of public safety and not, as some allege, to hinder access of the working classes in [[South Los Angeles|South]] and [[East Los Angeles (region)|East Los Angeles]] to his affluent district. In a letter to the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', Waxman cites the 2005 study: "The panel concurred as well that in 1985, the decision to hold further tunneling in abeyance was prudent, given the circumstances and extent of information and technology at that time. Much has changed since then to significantly improve tunneling and operation safety."<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/opinion/la-le-tuesday3.1jan03,1,2281424.story?ctrack=1&cset=true |archiveurl= http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/953695751.html?dids=953695751&FMT=ABS&FMTS=FT |archivedate=2006-01-03|title=The facts about Red Line safety|author=Henry Waxman|date= 2006-01-03|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref>

;Solyndra
Waxman, as the ranking member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, oversaw the case of [[Solyndra]], a solar company that filed for bankruptcy after receiving a $535 million loan guarantee from the DOE. Waxman recounted meeting with Solyndra's CEO two months before they filed for bankruptcy, who assured him that "Solyndra’s future was bright with sales and production booming."<ref name="Failed loan deal">{{cite news|last=McElhatton|first=Jim|title=Solyndra stays mum at hearing on failed loan deal|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/sep/23/solyndra-stays-mum-hearing-failed-loan-deal/|newspaper=The Washington Times|date=23 September 2011}}</ref> Waxman was accused of being involved with the Solyndra loan by [[Darrell Issa]].

His father was born in Montreal, Canada, and his mother was from Pennsylvania; all of his grandparents were Jewish immigrants from [[Russia]].<ref>http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~battle/reps/waxman.htm</ref> He attended college at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]], earning a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[political science]] in 1961 and a [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] degree from [[UCLA School of Law|UCLA's law school]] in 1964. After graduating, he worked as a lawyer. He was elected to the [[California Assembly]] in 1969 and served three terms. Along with Congressman [[Howard Berman]], Waxman co-founded the [[Los Angeles County Young Democrats]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Lowenfeld|first1=Jonah|title=California’s new citizen-led redistricting panel could force two Jewish Democrats into a face-off|url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/los_angeles/article/californias_new_citizen-led_redistricting_panel_could_force_two_jewish_demo|accessdate=21 August 2014|publisher=Jewish Journal|date=2011-07-19}}</ref>

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
In 1974, Democratic congressman [[Chet Holifield]] retired after 16 terms in Congress.  Waxman gave up his state assembly seat to run for the district, which had been renumbered from the 19th to the 24th in a mid-decade redistricting. Waxman won the Democratic nomination for the district, and easily won the general election, as this was [[tantamount to election]] in this heavily Democratic district. He has been re-elected 17 times with no substantive opposition. He faced no major-party opposition in 1986, and was completely unopposed in 2008. His district has changed numbers four times in his tenure—from the 24th (1975–1993) to the 29th (1993–2003) to the 30th (2003–2012) to the 33rd (2012). He was one of the last two members, along with [[George Miller (California politician)|George Miller]] of California, of the large Democratic freshman class of 1975.

Waxman's most recent district (until 2012), [[California's 30th congressional district]], included [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]], [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]], [[Agoura Hills, California|Agoura Hills]], [[Calabasas, California|Calabasas]], [[Hidden Hills, California|Hidden Hills]], [[Malibu, California|Malibu]], [[West Hollywood, California|West Hollywood]], and [[Westlake Village, California|Westlake Village]] as well as such areas of western Los Angeles as [[West Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California|West Los Angeles]], [[Fairfax District, Los Angeles, California|Fairfax]], [[Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles, California|Pacific Palisades]], [[Brentwood, Los Angeles, California|Brentwood]], [[Beverlywood, Los Angeles, California|Beverlywood]], [[Topanga, California|Topanga]], [[Chatsworth, Los Angeles, California|Chatsworth]], [[Palms, Los Angeles, California|Palms]], [[Westwood, Los Angeles, California|Westwood]], [[West Hills, Los Angeles, California|West Hills]], [[Westside Village, Los Angeles, California|Westside Village]], [[Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, California|Woodland Hills]], but through the creation of a new 33rd Congressional District by the California Citizens Redistricting Commission, in the November 2012 general election Waxman won re-election<ref name="2012election">http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/house-races/266603-waxman-fights-off-independent-opponent</ref> in an area including his home community of Beverly Hills and stretching to Malibu and Pacific-coastal communities heading south including Santa Monica, Manhattan Beach, Redondo Beach, Hermosa Beach, the Palos Verdes Peninsula and Northwest San Pedro.<ref>{{cite news|last=Marroquin|first=Art|title=House veteran Waxman will run in new district that includes South Bay|url=http://www.dailybreeze.com/news/ci_18774324|newspaper=The Daily Breeze|date=29 August 2011}}</ref>

===Tenure===
Before the Democrats lost control of the House of Representatives in 1995, Waxman was a powerful figure in the House as chair of the [[United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce#Subcommittees|Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health and the Environment]] from 1979. In this role he conducted investigations into a range of health and environmental issues, including universal health insurance, [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Medicaid]] coverage, [[AIDS]] and air and water pollution.  In 1994, Waxman forced the chief executives of the seven major tobacco companies to swear under oath that [[nicotine]] was not addictive.<ref name="1994 Tobacco Transcript">{{cite web|title=Inside the Tobacco Deal|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/settlement/timelines/april94.html|work=Frontline|publisher=PBS|accessdate=20 July 2012}}</ref>

Waxman's stated legislative priorities are health and environmental issues. These include universal health insurance, Medicare and Medicaid coverage, tobacco, AIDS, air and water quality standards, pesticides, nursing home quality standards, women's health research and reproductive rights, the availability and cost of prescription drugs, and the right of communities to know about pollution levels.  As an example of Waxman's thoughts regarding tobacco, on April 13, 2010, he requested that [[Major League Baseball]] ban smokeless tobacco in all its various forms - [[Snuff (tobacco)|snuff]], [[dipping tobacco]]. [[chewing tobacco]], [[snus]], etc.<ref>{{cite journal |date=April 26, 2010 |title=For the Record: Requested |journal=[[Sports Illustrated]] |volume=112 |issue=18 |page=16 |publisher=[[Time Inc.|Time]] |editor1-first=Terry |editor1-last=McDonell |editor1-link=Terry McDonell }}</ref>

With the Democrats' victory in the [[U.S. House election, 2006|2006 midterm elections]], Waxman became chairman of the [[United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform|House Oversight and Government Reform Committee]], the principal investigative committee of the House. He was the committee's ranking Democrat from 1997 to 2007.  In 1998, while he was still ranking member, he created a "Special Investigations Division" to investigate matters that he felt the full committee had neglected. This was possible because the committee has broad powers to investigate any matter with federal policy implications, even if another committee has jurisdiction over it.<ref>{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051215014917/www.democrats.reform.house.gov/investigations.asp |date=December 15, 2005 |title=Special Investigations }}. democrats.reform.house.gov. Retrieved on 2011-11-22.</ref> He has also harshly criticized the Republicans for ignoring their "constitutional responsibility" to conduct oversight over the government.<ref>{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051226041215/reform.democrats.house.gov/story.asp?id=706 |date=December 26, 2005 |title=Committee on Government Reform Minority Office }}. democrats.reform.house.gov. Retrieved on 2011-11-22.</ref>

On March 16, 2004, at Waxman's request, the Committee on Government Reform Minority Office published "Iraq on the Record, the Bush Administration's Public Statements on Iraq"<ref>Henry A. Waxman {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070813022744/http://oversight.house.gov/IraqOnTheRecord/ |date=August 13, 2007 |title=Iraq on the Record }}. oversight.house.gov</ref> a detailed and searchable collection of 237 specific misleading statements made by Bush Administration officials about the threat posed by Iraq. It contains statements that were misleading based on what was known to the Administration at the time the statements were made. It does not include statements that appear mistaken only in hindsight. If a statement was an accurate reflection of U.S. intelligence at the time it was made, it was excluded even if it now appears erroneous.

In 2006, Project On Government Oversight, a government watchdog group, presented Waxman with its Good Government Award for his various contributions to government transparency and oversight.<ref>[http://www.pogo.org/honorees/good-government-award/ Good Government Award Home Page.] Project On Government Oversight Website. Retrieved July 1, 2010.</ref>

On the day after the 2006 elections, Waxman directed his aides to draw up an "oversight plan" for the panel. He had already let it be known that he wanted to investigate [[Halliburton]], as well as its alleged malfeasance related to government contracts in [[Iraq]]. It is very likely that he could also investigate the numerous scandals surrounding [[Jack Abramoff]]. This led to concerns among Democratic aides that the Government Reform Committee under Waxman would stage a repeat of the committee's performance under the [[Clinton administration]], when it issued over 1,000 subpoenas. However, Waxman told ''[[Newsweek]]'' that he is interested in accountability and not retaliation.<ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15675859/site/newsweek/page/3/ Democrats’ Challenge: Stay in the Center – Newsweek National News – MSNBC.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061129231512/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15675859/site/newsweek/page/3/ |date=November 29, 2006 }}</ref>

In 2009, he began serving as the Chairman of the [[United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce|House Energy and Commerce Committee]] after defeating Chairman [[John Dingell]] in a 137–122 secret vote of House Democrats on November 20, 2008.

Senator [[Alan K. Simpson|Alan Simpson]] of Wyoming once described Waxman as being 'tougher than a boiled owl'.<ref>{{cite book |title=2014 Almanac of American Politics |last2=McCutcheon |first2=Chuck |last1=Barone|first1=Michael |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |year= 2013}}</ref>

Waxman is proud of his "strong Jewish identity" and has drawn political conclusions from his exploration of the religion.<ref name=trojanWaxman /> "Judaism is about acting and doing the right thing, not simply believing in it or mindlessly following ritual", he said in a speech presented by the [[University of Southern California]]'s Casden Institute for the Study of the Jewish Role in American Life.<ref name=trojanWaxman>{{cite news

He further said that the "Jewish values" of "human rights, social justice, and equal opportunities ... are synonymous with American values", and that such values "are in my opinion closer to a Democratic position." Waxman supported fellow representative [[Jane Harman]] during her primary challenge from Marcy Winograd when Winograd said she would support a one-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, instead of the two-state resolution endorsed by Waxman and Harman. Saying it suffers from "a culture of corruption" and "has become obsessed with secrecy," he accused the [[federal government of the United States|American government]] of having abandoned these values. "(The) Republican leadership ignores presidential rules and norms and has no consideration for custom," he said.<ref>{{cite news|last=Meier |first=Gretchen |title=Congressman lambastes Bush, Republicans on ethical issues |url=http://media.www.dailytrojan.com/media/storage/paper679/news/2006/04/24/News/Congressman.Lambastes.Bush.Republicans.On.Ethical.Issues-1866412.shtml |accessdate=7 November 2012 |newspaper=Daily Trojan |date=2006-04-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827163121/http://media.www.dailytrojan.com/media/storage/paper679/news/2006/04/24/News/Congressman.Lambastes.Bush.Republicans.On.Ethical.Issues-1866412.shtml |archivedate=August 27, 2008 }}</ref>

;Abortion
Waxman was strongly critical of the [[Stupak-Pitts Amendment]], which places limits on taxpayer-funded abortions in the context of the November 2009 [[Affordable Health Care for America Act]]. Instead of this version, it was reported that many Democrats supported a version that would find "common ground."<ref name="Public Plan Abortion">{{cite news|last=McCormack|first=John|title=Waxman Strong-arms Vote to Allow Abortion Coverage in Public Plan|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/weblogs/TWSFP/2009/07/house_democrat_introduces_comp.asp|accessdate=30 August 2012|newspaper=The Weekly Standard|date=31 July 2009}}</ref>

;1985 subway opposition
In 1985, Waxman sponsored a bill supported by affluent [[NIMBY|homeowners groups]] in his district to ban federal funding for the [[LACMTA Red Line|Red Line]] subway after a [[methane gas]] explosion in the [[Fairfax District, Los Angeles, California|Fairfax District]]. In 2005, a robust [[real estate]] market, multi-dwelling construction boom, and lack of public mass transit planning on the westside caused by Waxman's bill resulted in gridlock throughout Waxman's district.<ref>Christine Pelisek [http://www.laweekly.com/2005-03-03/news/red-line-to-somewhere/ Red Line to Somewhere], LA Weekly, 3 March 2005</ref> At the request of Los Angeles Mayor and [[LACMTA]] Board President [[Antonio Villaraigosa]], Waxman agreed to lift the ban if a panel of five engineers found tunneling under the [[Miracle Mile, Los Angeles, California|Miracle Mile]] stretch of Wilshire Boulevard to be safe. In October 2005, the panel decided that tunneling was possible, and on December 16, Waxman responded by announcing he would introduce a bill to the U.S. House that would lift the ban on federal money for subway tunneling in the district. This bill passed the House via unanimous vote on September 20, 2006.<ref>{{cite news |date=20 September 2006 |title=In boost to LA subway extension, House lifts tunneling ban |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2006/09/20/state/n171847D35.DTL&type=politics |newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |agency=Associated Press |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224191253/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2006/09/20/state/n171847D35.DTL&type=politics |archive-date=24 December 2007}}</ref>

Waxman maintains that the 1985 bill was sponsored in the interest of public safety and not, as some allege, to hinder access of the working classes in [[South Los Angeles|South]] and [[East Los Angeles (region)|East Los Angeles]] to his affluent district. In a letter to the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', Waxman cites the 2005 study: "The panel concurred as well that in 1985, the decision to hold further tunneling in abeyance was prudent, given the circumstances and extent of information and technology at that time. Much has changed since then to significantly improve tunneling and operation safety."<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/opinion/la-le-tuesday3.1jan03,1,2281424.story?ctrack=1&cset=true |archiveurl= http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/953695751.html?dids=953695751&FMT=ABS&FMTS=FT |archivedate=2006-01-03|title=The facts about Red Line safety|author=Henry Waxman|date= 2006-01-03|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref>

;Solyndra
Waxman, as the ranking member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, oversaw the case of [[Solyndra]], a solar company that filed for bankruptcy after receiving a $535 million loan guarantee from the DOE. Waxman recounted meeting with Solyndra's CEO two months before they filed for bankruptcy, who assured him that "Solyndra’s future was bright with sales and production booming."<ref name="Failed loan deal">{{cite news|last=McElhatton|first=Jim|title=Solyndra stays mum at hearing on failed loan deal|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/sep/23/solyndra-stays-mum-hearing-failed-loan-deal/|newspaper=The Washington Times|date=23 September 2011}}</ref> Waxman was accused of being involved with the Solyndra loan by [[Darrell Issa]].
