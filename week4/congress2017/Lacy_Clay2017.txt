'''William Lacy Clay, Jr.''' (born July 27, 1956), usually known as '''Lacy Clay''', is the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|Missouri|1|}}, serving since 2001. He is a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].

The district is based in the city of [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] and includes most of northern [[St. Louis County, Missouri|St. Louis County]] (North County), including cities such as [[Maryland Heights, Missouri|Maryland Heights]], [[University City, Missouri|University City]], and [[Florissant, Missouri|Florissant]].

== Early life, education and career ==
Clay Jr. was born in [[St. Louis, Missouri]],<ref>{{cite book

}}</ref> but his family moved to [[Washington, D.C.]] when his father, [[Bill Clay]], was elected to U.S. Congress. His mother was Carol Ann (Johnson).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~battle/reps/clay.htm |title=Lacy Clay ancestry |publisher=Freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com |date= |accessdate=2015-05-15}}</ref>

In his teenage years, Clay Jr. attended public schools in [[Silver Spring, Maryland]] and graduated in the [[Springbrook High School]] Class of 1974. He then attended the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland-College Park]], earning a degree in political science and certification to be a [[paralegal]]. Clay is a member of [[Kappa Alpha Psi]] fraternity.

==Missouri Legislature==
Clay  entered the [[Missouri House of Representatives]] in 1983, the same year that he graduated. In 1991, he was elected to the [[Missouri Senate]].

==U.S. House of Representatives==
In 2000, Clay Sr. retired after 32 years in the U.S. Congress. Clay Jr. won a crowded six-way Democratic primary—the real contest in this heavily Democratic district—with 60 percent of the vote, and breezed to election in November. He has been reelected six times with no substantive opposition, never dropping below 70 percent of the vote.

For his first six terms, Clay Jr. represented the northern two-thirds of St. Louis, while the southern third was located in [[Missouri's 3rd congressional district|the 3rd district]], represented by fellow Democrat [[Russ Carnahan]].  However, Missouri lost a congressional district as a result of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 Census]].  The final map resulted in the 3rd district being eliminated and the 1st district absorbing all of St. Louis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ozarksfirst.com/fulltext?nxd_id=431886 |title=UPDATE: House Redistricting Committee Unveils Map |publisher=OzarksFirst.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-31}}</ref> Clay beat Carnahan in the August 7, 2012 primary, 63% to 34%--all but handing him a seventh term.<ref name="primary">{{cite web |url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/william-lacy-clay-wins-easily-over-russ-carnahan/article_ca33460d-8ce4-5f0b-8a3e-7f31e70b9403.html |title=William Lacy Clay wins easily over Russ Carnahan |publisher=''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]'' |date=August 8, 2012}}</ref><ref name="results">{{cite web |url=http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/files/elections/2012/by_state/MO_US_House_0807.html?SITE=MOSTPELN&SECTION=POLITICS |title=Missouri - Summary Vote Results |date=August 8, 2012}}</ref>

Since his first term, Clay has been a member of the [[United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform|House Oversight and Government Reform Committee]]. He currently chairs the [[United States House Oversight and Government Reform Subcommittee on Information Policy, Census, and National Archives|House Information Policy Subcommittee]]. He is also a member of the [[House Financial Services Committee]]. Ordinarily, House Democrats who serve on the Financial Services Committee would have to give up their other committee assignments.  However, [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] [[Nancy Pelosi]] and House Financial Services Committee Chair [[Barney Frank]] of [[Massachusetts]] granted him a waiver allowing him to remain on the Oversight Committee.

Clay made headlines in early 2007 when, as a member of the [[Congressional Black Caucus]] (co-founded by his father), he objected to the possible inclusion of [[U.S. Representative]] [[Steve Cohen]] of [[Tennessee]], a [[White (U.S. Census)|Caucasian]] who represents the majority-[[African American (U.S. Census)|African American]] district in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] and had made a campaign promise to attempt to become the first white member of the CBC. Although it is not part of the CBC's bylaws that members must be black, all members so far have been black.<ref name="politico">{{cite web |url= http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0107/2389.html|title= Black Caucus: Whites Not Allowed|accessdate= 2007-06-28|publisher= ''[[The Politico]]''}}</ref> Clay told Cohen "that he could not collaborate with the Congressional Black Caucus for the benefit of his black constituents 'until your skin turns black.'"<ref>[[Thomas DiLorenzo|DiLorenzo, Thomas]] (2011-02-11) [http://archive.lewrockwell.com/dilorenzo/dilorenzo201.html My Associations with Liars, Bigots, and Murderers], ''[[LewRockwell.com]]''</ref> In response to press inquiries, he said, "Mr. Cohen asked for admission, and he got his answer. He's white and the Caucus is black. It's time to move on. We have racial policies to pursue and we are pursuing them, as Mr. Cohen has learned. It's an unwritten rule. It's understood." In response to the decision, Cohen stated, "It's their caucus and they do things their way. You don't force your way in."<ref name="politico"/> Clay issued an official statement from his office in reply to Cohen's complaint: "Quite simply, Rep. Cohen will have to accept what the rest of the country will have to accept — there has been an unofficial Congressional White Caucus for over 200 years, and now it's our turn to say who can join 'the club.' He does not, and cannot, meet the membership criteria, unless he can change his skin color. Primarily, we are concerned with the needs and concerns of the black population, and we will not allow white America to infringe on those objectives." Some have said that since Cohen represents a district with 60 percent of African American voters, that he has a legitimate interest in helping the goals of the CBC, and the decision should not be solely based on skin color.<ref name="politico"/>

[[Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington]] issued a report in June 2007 saying that Clay's sister Michelle Clay is a registered [[lobbyist]] for the [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] airport and previously for the city of [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]]. They reported that in the 2006 election cycle, Michelle Clay's law office, Clay and Associates, received $51,800 in consulting fees from her brother's campaign funds, along with an additional $9,963 for reimbursements. In the 2004 election cycle, Michelle Clay's firm received $52,514 for consulting, and in 2002 Michelle Clay herself was paid $32,00 for campaign management and legal fees. During the 2004 election, Clay's campaign reimbursed his father more than $6,000 for book purchases.<ref name="ethicsreport">{{cite web |url= http://www.citizensforethics.org/files/FINAL_FULL_REPORT.pdf|title= Family Affair|accessdate= 2007-06-28|publisher= ''[[Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington]]''}}</ref>

==Political positions==
Clay Jr.'s voting record has been decidedly [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]], like that of his father. He is a member of the [[Congressional Progressive Caucus]], of which his father was a founding member.

During Clay's previous seventeen years in the state legislature, he authored Missouri's Hate Crimes Law which included gender, sexual orientation and sexual identity in the criteria of what constitutes a [[hate crime]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Carey|first1=Charles|title=African-American Political Leaders|date=2014|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=9781438107806|page=52|accessdate=13 October 2016}}</ref>

Clay made it clear that he supports the [[Employment Non-Discrimination Act|Employment Non-discrimination Act]] which would make it illegal to discriminate against employees of any sexual orientation, notably [[LGBT]] workers.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} He also noted that he believes that the 33 states that are allowed to fire employees due to sexual orientation are in the wrong.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

Clay has been a consistent critic of the [[War in Iraq]] and was among those who voted against the [[Iraq War Resolution]] in 2002.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} Clay's [[National Political Awareness Test|NPAT]] also displays disagreement with elements of the [[War on Drugs]].{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

Clay added his name as cosponsor to a bill calling for the impeachment of [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Dick Cheney]], [[House Resolution 333]].{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

He was one of the 31 members in the U.S. House of Representatives who voted not to count the [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral vote]]s from [[Ohio]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential election]].<ref>http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2005/roll007.xml</ref>

Lacy Clay voted against the [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008]].<ref>http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2008/roll674.xml#NV</ref>

Clay is a supporter of the [[Federal Reserve]]'s program of [[quantitative easing]] and claims that it has led to economic recovery since the [[financial crisis of 2008]].<ref>See his opening statement in the video: http://financialservices.house.gov/Hearings/hearingDetails.aspx?NewsID=1752</ref>
