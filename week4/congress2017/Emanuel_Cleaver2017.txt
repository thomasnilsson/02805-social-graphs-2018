He is a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], and in January 2010, Cleaver became chair of the [[Congressional Black Caucus]].

==Early life, education and career==
Cleaver was born in [[Waxahachie, Texas]], the son of Marie (née McKnight) and Lucky G. Cleaver.<ref>http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~battle/reps/cleaver.htm</ref> He grew up in [[public housing]] in [[Wichita Falls, Texas]]. He graduated from [[Prairie View A&M University]] where he became a member of [[Alpha Phi Alpha]] fraternity.

Cleaver has been the pastor at the St. James United Methodist Church in [[Kansas City Missouri]] from March 1972 until June 28, 2009.<ref>http://www.stjamesumc.com/our-story/history/</ref>

==Early political career==
Cleaver served as Kansas City Councilman from 1979 to 1991 and as [[List of mayors of Kansas City, Missouri|Mayor of Kansas City]] for two terms from 1991 until 1999. He was the first [[African American]] Mayor of Kansas City. During the last days of his tenure as Mayor, Reverend Cleaver agreed to an international visit to [[London, England]].

===Loan default===
On April 6, 2012, the ''Kansas City Star'' reported that [[Bank of America]] had sued Cleaver Company LLC over a commercial real estate loan for a [[Grandview, Missouri|Grandview]] car wash. In a lawsuit filed March 30, Bank of America said Cleaver, his wife Dianne, and the company owed over $1.46 million on the loan.<ref>{{cite news|title=BOA sues Cleaver, company for $1.5 million |url=http://www.businessweek.com/ap/2012-04/D9TVG6EG3.htm |newspaper=BusinessWeek |date=April 6, 2012 |agency=Associated Press |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304030506/http://www.businessweek.com/ap/2012-04/D9TVG6EG3.htm |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Helling|first=Dave|last2=Kraske|first2=Steve|title=Taxpayers could have to cover Rep.

==Political campaigns==
[[File:Emanuel Cleaver, official Congressional photo portrait.JPG|thumb|right|Earlier official photo of Cleaver]]
In late 2003, [[Karen McCarthy]], who had represented the 5th Congressional District since 1995, announced her retirement. Despite having served in city government for 20 years, including eight years as mayor, Cleaver initially posted weak numbers in the Democratic primary and general elections. Cleaver went on to defeat former [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]] Administration official [[Jamie Metzl]] in the Democratic primary by a margin of 60-40 percent. In the general election, [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Jeanne Patterson made the race far more competitive than conventional wisdom would suggest for the district, which has long been reckoned as the second-most Democratic district in Missouri (behind the [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]]-based [[Missouri's 1st congressional district|1st Congressional District]]). The Democrats have held this seat for all but eight years since 1909, and without interruption since 1949. By comparison, McCarthy won 65 percent of the vote in 2002.

===2008 Democratic Presidential Primary Election===
During the course of the contentious 2008 Democratic Presidential Primary, Cleaver endorsed [[Hillary Clinton]].<ref>[http://www.hillaryclinton.com/news/release/view/?id=2953 Missouri Rep. Emanuel Cleaver II Endorses Clinton] ''hillaryclinton.com'', August 21, 2007</ref> Cleaver claimed that African American [[superdelegate]]s who supported Clinton were subjected to harassment, threatened with primary opponents and called “[[Uncle Tom]].” He said they were told, “You’re not black if you’re not supporting [[Barack Obama]]. … It's ugly.”<ref>[http://primebuzz.kcstar.com/?q=node/10266 Cleaver: Black superdelegates backing Clinton are being "threatened"] ''Kansas City Star'', Keith Chrostowski, February 28, 2008</ref> On March 30, 2008, he was interviewed on ''The Sunday Edition'' on [[CBC Radio]] and said he realized he was on the losing team: "Even though I don't expect the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] to beat the [[Indianapolis Colts]], I cheer for the Kansas City Chiefs." <ref>[http://www.slate.com/blogs/blogs/trailhead/archive/2008/04/01/what-not-to-say-on-canadian-radio.aspx What Not To Say on Canadian Radio], Christopher Beam, ''Slate'', April 1, 2008</ref> According to [http://BlackMissouri.com BlackMissouri.com].,<ref>[http://blackmissouri.com/digest/emanuel-cleaver-of-missouri-endorses-hillary-clinton.html Emanuel Cleaver of Missouri Endorses Hillary] ''blackmissouri.com'', February 15, 2008</ref> [[U.S. Representative]] [[Jesse Jackson, Jr.|Jesse Jackson Jr.]] of [[Illinois]] asked Cleaver, “If it comes down to the last day and you’re the only superdelegate? … Do you want to go down in history as the one to prevent a black from winning the [[White House]]?" “I told him I’d think about it," Cleaver explained. Cleaver said during the course of the primary he'd be shocked if Obama wasn't the next President but made it clear he still supported Clinton until she suspended her bid.
