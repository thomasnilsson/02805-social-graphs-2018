===Elections===
;2007
{{Main article|Georgia's 10th congressional district special election, 2007}}
In February 2007, Republican U.S. Congressman [[Charlie Norwood]], of [[Georgia's 10th congressional district]], died of cancer. Broun announced his candidacy before Dr. Norwood passed. There was a special election open primary in June 2007, where candidates of all parties participated in the primary. A candidate needed 50% to win outright, and there would be a run-off if no candidate earned it the first time. Ten candidates filed: six  Republicans, three Democrats, and a Libertarian. State Senator [[Jim Whitehead (politician)|Jim Whitehead]] was the only elected politician to run, and was the front-runner. He won the endorsement of Senator [[Saxby Chambliss]] (R-GA).

In the primary, Whitehead finished first with 44% of the vote. Broun qualified for the run-off, ranking second with 21% of the vote, with only 198 votes more than third-place finisher James Marlow, a Democrat. Broun won a plurality of just four counties: [[Oconee County, Georgia|Oconee]] (47%), [[Jackson County, Georgia|Jackson]] (42%), [[Oglethorpe County, Georgia|Oglethorpe]] (37%), and [[Morgan County, Georgia|Morgan]] (31%).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sos.georgia.gov/elections/election_results/2007_0619/026.htm |title=6/19/2007 – U.S. Representative, District 10 |publisher=Sos.georgia.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-11-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=343830 |title=GA – District 10- Special Election Race – Jun 19, 2007 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2012-11-29}}</ref>

In the runoff campaign, Whitehead angered some voters by failing to appear at a debate held in Athens and then by referring to his [[alma mater]], the University of Georgia, as a "liberal bastion" that should be eliminated, save for the football team.<ref name=cq>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/cq/2007/07/24/cq_3155.html |work=Congressional Quarterly |publisher=The New York Times |title=Georgia Conservative Broun Fulfills House Dreams With Special Win |last=Kapochunas |first=Rachel |date=July 24, 2007 |accessdate=2007-07-25}}</ref> In the July 17, 2007 election, Broun upset Whitehead by a margin of just 0.8%, a difference of just 394 votes. After the votes were certified, Whitehead declined to ask for a recount despite the narrow margin.<ref name=cq/> Broun won the counties in the Northern part of the district, while Whitehead won the counties in the southern part. Broun's best two performing counties were [[Clarke County, Georgia|Clarke]] (90%) and Oconee (88%).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=373459 |title=GA – District 10- Special Election Runoff Race – Jul 17, 2007 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2012-11-29}}</ref>

{{Main article|United States House of Representatives elections in Georgia, 2008#District 10}}
Broun was challenged by Republican State Representative and House Majority Leader [[Barry Fleming]], who had endorsed Whitehead in the 2007 election. Broun defeated Fleming in the July 2008 primary, 71%–29%. He won every county in the district. However, his weakest performance was in the Southeastern part. He won counties like Richmond with just 52% and Columbia with just 58%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=384606 |title=GA District 10 – R Primary Race – Jul 15, 2008 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2012-11-29}}</ref> He won the general election with 61% to 39% against Democrat Bobby Saxon.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=387950 |title=GA – District 10 Race – Nov 4, 2008 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2012-11-29}}</ref>

A leaked video of a speech given at Liberty Baptist Church Sportsman's Banquet on September 27, 2012, shows Broun telling supporters that, "All that stuff I was taught about evolution and embryology and the Big Bang Theory, all that is lies straight from the pit of Hell."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/oct/07/nation/la-na-nn-paul-broun-evolution-hell-20121007|title=U.S. Rep.

In response to these remarks, coupled with Broun being on the [[House Science Committee]], libertarian radio talk show host [[Neil Boortz]] spearheaded a campaign to run the English naturalist and evolutionary theorist [[Charles Darwin]] against Broun, with the intention of drawing attention to these comments from the scientific community and having Broun removed from his post on the House Science Committee.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/17/paul-broun-charles-darwin_n_1974054.html|title=Paul Broun, Charles Darwin Face Off: Republican Faces Odd Write-In Opponent In Georgia House Race|date=Oct 17, 2012|accessdate=2012-10-21|work=[[The Huffington Post]]}}</ref>
