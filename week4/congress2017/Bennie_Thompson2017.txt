'''Bennie Gordon Thompson''' (born January 28, 1948) is the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|MS|2}}, serving since 1993, and the ranking member of the [[United States House Committee on Homeland Security|Committee on Homeland Security]] since 2011. He is a member of the [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]].<ref>{{cite news |title= Rep. Bennie Thompson|author=|url= http://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/bennie_thompson/400402|newspaper= GovTrack|date= |accessdate=August 14, 2012}}</ref>

The district includes most of [[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]] and is the only majority-black district in the state. The district is approximately {{convert|275|mi|km}} long, {{convert|180|mi|km}} wide and borders the Mississippi River. The [[Mississippi Delta]] comprises the vast majority of the 2nd District. He is both the first Democrat and the first African American to chair the Homeland Security Committee in the House.

==Early life, education and career==
Thompson is a lifelong resident of [[Bolton, Mississippi|Bolton]], near Jackson. He attended [[Hinds County, Mississippi|Hinds County]] public schools before earning a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in [[political science]] from [[Tougaloo College]] in 1968  and an [[Master of Science|M.S.]] in [[educational leadership|educational administration]] from [[Jackson State University]] in 1973. He served as an [[alderman]], then [[mayor]] of Bolton before being elected to the Hinds County [[Board of Supervisors]].

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Committee assignments===
*'''[[United States House Committee on Homeland Security|Committee on Homeland Security]]''' (Ranking Member)
**As Ranking Member of the full committee, Rep. Thompson may serve as an ''ex officio'' member of all subcommittees.

[[File:Bennie Thompson, official 109th Congress photo.jpg|thumb|left|Earlier photo of Congressman Bennie Thompson]]
Thompson also belongs to the [[Congressional Black Caucus]], Congressional Progressive Caucus, Congressional Rural Caucus, Congressional Sunbelt Caucus, Renewable Energy & Energy Efficiency Caucus, Congressional Travel & Tourism Caucus, and the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] Caucus. He also is involved in the Congressional Children's Working Group and the [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] & Reserve Components Congressional Members Organization.

===Tenure===
Thompson entered a crowded seven-way special election held on April 13, 1993 after [[Mike Espy]] gave up the seat to become [[United States Secretary of Agriculture|Secretary of Agriculture]].  With five other Democrats splitting the vote, he finished second behind Republican Hayes Dent with 28 percent of the vote.  He then defeated Dent in the April 13 runoff with 55 percent of the vote.  He won the seat in his own right in 1994 and has been reelected eight times.  He has only faced serious opposition twice, when journalist [[Clinton LeSueur]] held him to 55 percent in 2002 and 58 percent in 2004.

Thompson became an outspoken advocate for the [[Gulf Coast]] after Hurricanes [[Hurricane Katrina|Katrina]] and [[Hurricane Rita|Rita]] hit in 2005. From his position on the [[Homeland Security]] Committee, he pushed for accountability at the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) and a careful review of the role of the [[Red Cross]] in the time of disaster. He also pursued waste, [[fraud]], and abuse in hurricane contracting and called for preferences to be given to small and Gulf Coast businesses in the recovery and rebuilding of the affected states. Thompson is the founding Member of the bipartisan Gulf Coast Recovery & Rebuilding Caucus in the House of Representatives.

Thompson's voting record has been decidedly liberal; he is arguably one of the most liberal congressmen ever to represent Mississippi.  He is a founding member of the [[Congressional Progressive Caucus]].  His legislative platform focuses mainly on homeland security, [[civil rights]], agriculture and rural issues, equal education and [[health care]] reform. In 1975, he became one of the original plaintiffs in the [[Ayers Case]], which concerned the adequate funding of predominantly black educational institutes in Mississippi. In 2000, Thompson wrote legislation that created the National Center for Minority Health and Health Care Disparities.

During his tenure as chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, Thompson focused on assuring that state and local officials, as well as [[first responder]]s (fire, police, EMTs), got the resources they needed to protect their communities.  Thompson was particularly concerned about local officials getting adequate resources, having been a volunteer firefighter and a local elected official for 24 years.

He was one of the 31 who voted in the House to refuse to count the [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral vote]]s from [[Ohio]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential election]]. [http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2005/roll007.xml]

Along with [[John Conyers]], in April 2006, Thompson brought an action against [[George W. Bush]] and others alleging violations of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] in the passing of the [[Deficit Reduction Act of 2005]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory?id=1898817 |title=11 House Members to Sue Over Budget Bill |date=April 27, 2006 |accessdate=February 20, 2007 |work=ABC News |author=Associated Press}}</ref> The case (''[[Conyers v. Bush]]'') was ultimately dismissed.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory?id=2633701 |title=Judge Dismisses Budget Bill Lawsuit |date=November 6, 2006|accessdate=November 28, 2006 |work=ABC News |author=Associated Press}}</ref>

On January 5, 2007, Thompson introduced H.R.1, "Implementing the 9/11 Commission Recommendations Act of 2007," the first bill of the 110th Congress. The bill, cosponsored by more than 100 House Members, provided for the implementation of the 9/11 Commission's remaining recommendations. It included provisions requiring major improvements in aviation security, border security, and infrastructure security; providing first responders the equipment and training they need; beefing up efforts to prevent terrorists from acquiring weapons of mass destruction; and significantly expanding diplomatic, economic, educational, and other strategies designed to counter terrorism. The bill had bipartisan support and passed 299-128 on January 9, 2007.  On July 27, 2007, the Conference Report on H.R. 1 passed the House overwhelmingly, 371-40. The previous day, it had passed the Senate 85-8.  The President signed H.R. 1 into law on August 3, 2007.

With the passage of H.R. 1, Thompson is the first African-American Chairman of a House Committee to have a House-Senate Conference on the first bill introduced in either the House or the Senate in any given Congress.

On December 27, 2009, commenting on reports that [[Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab]], who had allegedly tried to set off a [[suicide bomb]] on [[Northwest Airlines Flight 253]] on December 25, 2009, had subsequently confessed to being trained and equipped in Yemen,<ref name="Upi2009-12-27">

Thompson called for a halt to all current plans with regard to Yemen in light of Abdulmutullab's ties there, including plans to repatriate approximately 80 [[Yemeni captives in Guantanamo]].

Thompson is a supporter, and one of the proposers of, a recent proposed bill to prevent auto insurance companies from using credit scores to set auto insurance rates.  The result of this bill if passed would be drastically lowered auto insurance rates to help Americans already in financial struggle.  Auto insurance rates would be more based solely on factors directly related to auto mobility instead of arbitrary factors such as debt or poor credit elsewhere.<ref>{{cite news |title= House Dems look to ban auto insurers from using credit scores to set rates|author= Pete Kasperowicz |url= http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/238063-house-dems-look-to-ban-auto-insurers-from-using-credit-scores-to-set-rates|newspaper= The Hill|date=July 17, 2012|accessdate= }}</ref>

Thompson has also been a supporter of a measure to increase screening and background checks for pilot trainees to reduce chances of terrorist exploitation.  The bill, H.R. 6159 would require all applicants to go through a waiting period while they were screened and cleared by the Department of Homeland Security.  Currently only foreign born trainees are required to go through this screening, but this bill would extend the precautions taken to all American applicants.<ref>{{cite news |title= Dems would require pilot trainees to be checked against terror watchlist|author= Pete Kasperowicz|url= http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/239237-dems-would-require-pilot-trainees-to-be-checked-against-terror-watchlist|newspaper= The Hill|date=July 20, 2012|accessdate=August 14, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title= Rep.

Thompson joined hands with Senator Ron Wyden and introduced a bill to limit the number of documents that are classified and to overhaul the security clearance system in July 2014. The bill's fate is currently unclear.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hicks|first1=Josh|title=Does the government have a problem with ‘runaway’ document classification?|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2014/07/31/does-the-government-have-a-problem-with-runaway-document-classification/|website=|publisher=''The Washington Post''|accessdate=August 1, 2014}}</ref>

===Legislation sponsored===
* [[Aviation Security Stakeholder Participation Act of 2013 (H.R. 1204; 113th Congress)]] - Thompson introduced this bill on March 14, 2013.<ref name=1204sum>{{cite web|title=H.R. 1204 - Summary|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th/house-bill/1204|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=December 4, 2013}}</ref> If it became law, the bill would direct the [[Transportation Security Administration]] to establish in the TSA an Aviation Security Advisory Committee and consult with it about matters of aviation security.

===Elections===
Thompson joined the House of Representatives in April 1993, after winning a special election for the 2nd Congressional seat, which became vacant when Representative [[Mike Espy]] resigned. He was elected to a full term in 1994, and has been reelected six times.

Thompson has had very successful campaign financing and has raised about 1.2 million dollars.  This is about 200 times the amount raised by his closest competitor, Republican Bill Marcy.  He has spent much of these funds on television, radio, and print advertisement for his campaign.<ref>{{cite news |title= Thompson's fundraising eclipses challengers|author= Deborah Barfield Berry|url= http://www.clarionledger.com/article/20120717/NEWS/120717043/Thompson-s-fundraising-eclipses-challengers|newspaper= Clarion Ledger|date= July 17, 2012|accessdate= }}</ref>
