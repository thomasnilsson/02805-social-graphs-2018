==New York State Assembly==
In 1977, Engel entered the special election for a seat in the [[New York State Assembly]] after the incumbent Democrat [[Alan Hochberg]] was forced to resign. He risked all of his life savings and won by 103 votes. He was the [[Liberal Party of New York|Liberal Party]] nominee in the special election, and on March 1, 1977, he defeated Democratic nominee Ted Weinstein and Republican nominee Arlene Siegel.<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9502E0D9143DE034BC4A53DFB566838C669EDE ''Engel, a Liberal, Barely Wins Race for Assembly''] in the ''[[New York Times]]'' on March 2, 1977 (subscription required)</ref>

===Attendance at the State of the Union address===

Engel can be seen shaking hands with the president during televised [[State of the Union address]]es.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2009/02/obama-speech.html |title=The Democrat who hogs the aisle seat at every presidential address to Congress &#124; Top of the Ticket |publisher=Latimesblogs.latimes.com |date=2009-02-24 |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref> Along with other Members of Congress, Engel shows up to the [[United States Capitol|Capitol]] early in order to guarantee that he will get an aisle seat. Engel has managed to shake hands with the president at every address, and be seen by his constituents on television since 1989. He has expressed that, "It's an honor to shake the hand of the president of the United States no matter who it is."<ref>{{cite news|last=Ann |first=Mary |url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/sleuth/2009/02/obama_makes_rep_engel_21_for_2.html |title=The Sleuth - Obama Makes Rep.

==Political positions==

===Healthcare reform===
Engel supports quality access to [[health care]], and refers to himself as [[pro-choice]] "all the way".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/1992/08/02/nyregion/issue-in-campaign-is-biaggi-s-record-but-which-one.html?n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/People/E/Engel,%20Eliot%20L. | work=The New York Times | title=Issue in Campaign Is Biaggi's Record, but Which One? | first=David | last=Gonzalez | date=August 2, 1992 | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref> Engel is a co-sponsor of the [[United States National Health Care Act]], which would implement a single-payer health care system in the United States. He was a strong supporter of the landmark [[Affordable Care Act]], committing his vote only after securing provisions that [[New York (state)|New York]] would not be penalized for being a [[do-gooder]] state.<ref>{{YouTube|XfHacBIrykI}}</ref>

In 2008, Engel authored the [[ALS Registry Act]] (P.L. 110-373),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alsa.org/news/article.cfm?id=1365 |title=ALS Registry Act Signed by President - The ALS Association |publisher=Alsa.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref> which established a national registry for the collection and storage of data on those suffering from ALS. He also authored the [[Paul D. Wellstone]] [[Muscular Dystrophy Act]] (P.L. 110-361),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opencongress.org/bill/110-h5265/show |title=H.R.5265: Paul D. Wellstone Muscular Dystrophy Community Assistance, Research, and Education Amendments of 2008 |publisher= OpenCongress |date=2008-02-08 |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref> which promoted research at Centers of Excellence for Muscular Dystrophy.

He wrote the [[Partnering to Improve Maternity Care Quality Act]], introduced in 2010, to improve maternity care for mothers and newborns, and to do so in partnership with doctors, advocates, payers, and purchasers. In 2010, Engel wrote the [[Gestational Diabetes Act of 2010]], which passed the House, but didn't come to a vote in the Senate. The legislation could be re-introduced in the [[113th Congress]] for consideration. The legislation would provide for better tracking and research into gestational diabetes, which, if untreated, could lead to [[Type 2 diabetes]] for both mother and child.

===Global health===
Rep. Engel supports an improved re-authorization of the [[President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief]] (PEPFAR). Within the PEPFAR bill, Engel included his bill, the Stop Tuberculosis Now Act.<ref>{{cite web |author=Robyn Shepherd |url=http://www.results.org/blog/mdr-tb_photos_displayed_in_u.s._capitol/ |title=http://www.results.org/blog/mdr-tb_photos_displayed_in_u.s._capitol/ |publisher=RESULTS |date=June 19, 2009 |accessdate=2014-01-07}}</ref> This measure provides increased U.S. support for international [[Tuberculosis management|Tuberculosis control]] activities, and promotes research to develop new drugs, diagnostics, and vaccines.

===Energy===
In 2005, Engel, along with Congressman [[Jack Kingston]] (R-GA), introduced the Fuel Choices for American Security Act (H.R. 4409), later modified and re-introduced in 2007 as the DRIVE Act (H.R. 670) - the Dependence Reduction through Innovation in Vehicles and Energy Act - with more than 80 bi-partisan co-sponsors. It was designed to promote America's [[national security]] and economic stability by reducing dependence on foreign oil through the use of clean [[alternative fuels]] and advanced vehicle technologies. It also called for increased tire efficiency - to increase a vehicle's gas miles.<ref>http://fdsys.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2007-01-24/pdf/CREC-2007-01-24-pt1-PgE193.pdf</ref>

Many provisions of the DRIVE Act were included in the [[Energy Independence and Security Act]], which was signed into law on December 19, 2007, and became Public Law No. 110-140. This law mandates increased fuel efficiency standards from 25 miles per gallon to 35 miles per gallon by 2020. The law also requires improved energy efficiency standards for appliances, lighting and buildings, and the development of American-grown [[biofuel]]s like [[cellulosic ethanol]], [[biodiesel]], and [[biobutanol]].

On July 22, 2008, Engel introduced, with Congressmen Kingston, [[Steve Israel]] (D-NY), and [[Bob Inglis]] (R-SC) the Open Fuel Standards Act.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-h1476/show |title=H.R.1476: Open Fuel Standard Act of 2009 - U.S. Congress |publisher=OpenCongress |date=2009-04-20 |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref> This bill requires 50 percent of new cars sold in the [[United States]] by 2012 (and 80 percent of new cars sold by 2015) to be [[flexible-fuel vehicle]]s capable of running on any combination of [[ethanol]], [[methanol]], or [[gasoline]]. Flex fuel vehicles cost about $100 more than the same vehicle in a gasoline-only version. This bill was re-submitted in the [[111th United States Congress]] by Rep. Engel, Inglis, Israel, and [[Roscoe Bartlett]] (R-MD). It was re-introduced in the [[112th Congress]], with Rep. John Shimkus as the lead Republican. It will likely be re-introduced in the [[113th Congress]].

Engel is the senior Representative from New York on the [[United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce|Energy and Commerce Committee]], and the Representative from New York on the Subcommittee on Energy and the Environment. He played a key role in negotiating the American Clean Energy and Security Act, HR 2454,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://209.18.106.110/speech_detail.php?sc_id=476938&keyword=&phrase=&contain= |title=Project Vote Smart - Representative Eliot L.

===Gun control===
Engel believes in requiring background checks on gun sales between private citizens at gun shows,<ref name="OnTheIssues">{{cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/NY/Eliot_Engel_Gun_Control.htm |title=On the Issues - Elliot Engel on Gun Control |publisher=ontheissues.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-03}}</ref> and disagrees with the statement that, "District of Columbia does not have the authority to enact laws or regulations that 'discourage or eliminate' private ownership or use of firearms."<ref name="AboutPolitics">{{cite web|url=http://aboutpolitics.com/politicians/New%20York-NY/Engel/Gun%20Issues |title=Political Voting Records: New York-NY, Engel: Gun Issues |publisher=aboutpolitics.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-03}}</ref> Rep. Engel signed a letter to President [[Barack Obama]] urging the "return to enforcement of the law banning imports of [[assault weapons]], which was previously enforced during the administrations of Presidents [[George H.W. Bush]] and [[Bill Clinton]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.internationalrelations.house.gov/press_display.asp?sub_id=141 |title=U.S. House Committee on Foreign Affairs |publisher=Internationalrelations.house.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref> He also opposed a bill that would allow visitors to carry firearms while inside certain [[national parks]].<ref name="GovTrackUS">{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/vote.xpd?vote=h2009-277 |title=GovTrack: House Vote #277 (May 20, 2009) |publisher=govtrack.us |date= |accessdate=2010-09-03}}</ref>

Engel has received an "F" grade from the [[National Rifle Association]]. Engel strongly believes in restricting citizen gun use through "smart gun" technology, extending waiting periods for citizens, and allowing the victims of gun violence to sue firearm manufacturers and authorized sellers.<ref name="OnTheIssues"/>

Conversely, Engel has received a 100 percent rating from the [[Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.votesmart.org/issue_rating_detail.php?r_id=2507 |title=Project Vote Smart - Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence Rating |publisher=Votesmart.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref> He has also been given a 100 percent grade from the [[Coalition to Stop Gun Violence]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.votesmart.org/issue_rating_detail.php?r_id=2453 |title=Project Vote Smart - Coalition to Stop Gun Violence Rating |publisher=Votesmart.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref> Engel repeatedly votes in favor of stricter gun control laws. He introduced H.R. 1784, the Protect Law Enforcement Armor (PLEA) Act, which would ban the [[Five-seveN]] handguns. Engel introduced H.R. 2217, intended to protect parents and children from faulty gun locks by instructing the [[Consumer Product Safety Commission]] (CPSC) to set a national quality standard for all child safety devices used on firearms.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://wap.cbsnews.com/site?sid=cbsnews&pid=sections.detail&catId=TOP&index=1&storyId=270382&viewFull=yes |title=CBS News Mobile 400,000 Gun Locks Recalled |publisher=Wap.cbsnews.com |date=2001-02-07 |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref>

===Other domestic issues===
On December 22, 2010, President Barack Obama signed into law the [[Truth in Caller ID Act]]. The legislation was introduced by [[Bill Nelson]] in the Senate, passed the House on December 15, and is virtually identical to Rep. Engel's bill.<ref>{{cite web

Rep. Engel originally introduced the Securing our Borders and Our Data Act in July 2008, HR 6702.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theorator.com/bills110/text/hr6702.html |title=HR 6702 - Securing Our Borders and Our Data Act of 2008 - U.S. House Bill |publisher=Theorator.com |date=2008-07-31 |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref> That bill would ensure that when a traveler enters the United States, a border agent cannot search or seize the traveler's data or equipment without cause.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/01/AR2008080103030.html |title=Travelers' Laptops May Be Detained At Border |publisher=washingtonpost.com |date= 2008-08-01|accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref> The legislation was re-introduced in the 111th Congress as HR 239.<ref>[http://www.allbusiness.com/crime-law-enforcement-corrections/law-search-seizure/12572527-1.html ]{{dead link|date=August 2010}}</ref> The [[Department of Homeland Security]] altered their rules to prevent agents from searching and seizing without cause.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/171101/dhs_clarifies_laptop_border_crossing_rules_what_you_need_to_know.html |title=DHS Clarifies Laptop Border Crossing Rules: What You Need to Know |publisher=PCWorld |date=2009-08-29 |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref> This encompassed much of Rep. Engel's legislation.

In the 109th Congress, Engel introduced the Calling Card Consumer Protection Act, HR 3402.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opencongress.org/bill/110-h3402/show |title=H.R.3402: Calling Card Consumer Protection Act - U.S. Congress |publisher=OpenCongress |date=2008-09-10 |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref> The bill was intended to stop some of the massive fraud in the prepaid calling card industry.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rios |first=Kristofer |url=http://www.indypressny.org/nycma/voices/380/news/news/ |title=Voices That Must Be Heard: Calling home – and losing minutes - New York Community Media Alliance |publisher=Indypressny.org |date=2009-06-30 |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref> The legislation passed the House unanimously, but the Senate did not act on it. In 2011, Rep. Engel introduced the [[Drug Testing Integrity Act]], which would prohibit products to be sold that enable cheating on drug tests.

In 2010, Engel urged the [[Federal Housing Finance Agency]] to stop their plan to ban private transfer fees on [[cooperative apartment]] sales. Some developers and investors had been [[abusing the system]] by imposing transfer fees that would have provided them with percentages on all future sales of the property over many decades. The transfer fee, when used correctly, can help owners and developers fund projects and remain affordable. The FHFA decided not to pursue this plan in 2011.

In 2012, Engel introduced [[SNOPA]], the Social Network Online Protection Act. It guarantees online privacy, and ensures that employers and educational institutions cannot use personal data as a bargaining chip for employment or education. Employers/schools would be barred from requesting or requiring usernames or passwords to social media sites as part of the hiring, employment, or enrollment process. The bill has been re-introduced in the [[113th Congress]], with Rep. Michael Grimm as the Republican lead, and Rep. Jan Schakowski as an original co-sponsor.

===International affairs===
Engel is a supporter of recognizing [[Jerusalem]] as the capital of [[Israel]], and has also been an advocate for the causes of [[Albania]]n-Americans and ethnic Albanians in [[Kosovo]]. In 2003, he authored the [[Syria Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act]], which was signed into law by President [[George W. Bush]] on December 12, 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.congress.gov/cgi-bin/query/F?c108:6:./temp/~c108K7fnhG:e796: |title=Bill Text - 108th Congress (2003-2004) - THOMAS (Library of Congress) |publisher=Congress.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref> In this Law, Congress authorized penalties and restrictions on US relations with [[Syria]] for its occupation of [[Lebanon]], and for its relationship with terrorist groups.

====Western Hemisphere Subcommittee====
As Chairman of the House of Representatives [[Foreign Affairs]] Subcommittee on the [[Western Hemisphere]], Engel has called for stronger U.S. relations with [[Latin America]] and the [[Caribbean]]. His Subcommittee has held hearings on issues such as the crisis in [[Haiti]], poverty, and inequality in Latin America.

Engel pushed for increased funding for emergency relief in Haiti, and for Temporary Protective Status (TPS) of Haitian nationals in the U.S.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ijdh.org/articles/article_recent_news_7-23-09.html |title=Institute for Justice and Democracy in Haiti |publisher=Ijdh.org |date=2009-07-22 |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref> Engel is also supportive of the "[[Mérida Initiative]]", in which the U.S. is cooperating with [[Mexico]], [[Central America]], the [[Dominican Republic]], and Haiti to counter [[narco-trafficking]] and related violence in the region. In the [[110th United States Congress]], he introduced the Social Investment and Economic Development Act for the Americas of 2007<ref>{{cite web

Engel has been a vocal supporter of [[Israel]]. In 2008, he was the lead Democrat on a resolution condemning [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] rocket attacks on Israeli civilians by [[Hamas]] and other Palestinian terrorist organizations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/US-Israel/HR951.html |title=House Resolution Condemning Palestinian Rocket Attacks (January 29, 2008) |publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref> Shortly after entering Congress, he sponsored a resolution declaring [[Jerusalem]] the undivided capital of Israel.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/engel.html |title=Eliot Engel |publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |date=1947-02-18 |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref> He also wrote the [[Syria Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act]], which was signed into law by President [[George W.

====Kosovo and the Balkans====
In 1996, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' wrote, "The [[Kosovo]] cause has been kept alive in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] by a small group of congressmen led by Rep. Eliot L. Engel (D-N.Y.)...."<ref>{{cite web |author=Michael Dobbs |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-796746.html |title=Kosovo's Albanians Look to U.S. for Help; American Office Opened in Serb-Ruled Region |work=The Washington Post |date=1996-07-21 |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref> While a member of the Subcommittee on Europe and Chair of the Congressional Albanian Issues Caucus, Engel fought [[ethnic cleansing]] in Kosovo in 1999 and voiced support in Congress for independence of Kosovo. A street has been named after him in [[Peć]], and he was the first foreign dignitary to address the Kosovo parliament.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/05/02/driving-down-congressman-engel-boulevard-in-kosovo/ | work=The New York Times | title=Driving Down Congressman Engel Boulevard, in Kosovo | first=Sewell | last=Chan | date=May 2, 2008 | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref>

====Cyprus====
Engel called for the withdrawal of [[Turkey|Turkish]] troops from [[Cyprus]], and authored a resolution in 1996 calling for its [[demilitarization]]. His 1994 law allowed the [[United States Department of State]] to conduct an investigation of five Americans who disappeared during the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]], and found the remains of one.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.pseka.net/index.php?id=97&module=article |title=Community Call To Action To Support Congressman Eliot Engel (Pseka) |publisher=News.pseka.net |date=2001-12-21 |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref> Engel received the [[George Paraskevaides]] Award on May 17, 2007, given to those who have utilized ancient [[wikt:Hellenic|Hellenic]] values to contribute to the nations and people of Cyprus and America and to the Hellenics in the modern world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.pseka.net/uploads/img/documents/PSEKA-SAE_2007_Conference_EN_01_CEH_01.pdf |title=The National Coordinated Effort Of Hellenes (Ceh) |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref>

====Iraq War====
In 2002, Engel joined the two [[United States Senate|Senators]] from [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Chuck Schumer]] and [[Hillary Clinton]], and almost 300 members of the [[United States House of Representatives]] in voting for the resolution granting President Bush the authority to use force in Iraq.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/11/us/threats-responses-vote-congress-authorizes-bush-use-force-against-iraq-creating.html?pagewanted=1 | work=The New York Times | title=Threats And Responses: The Vote; Congress Authorizes Bush To Use Force Against Iraq, Creating A Broad Mandate | first1=Alison | last1=Mitchell | first2=Carl | last2=Hulse | date=October 11, 2002 | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref> After revelations that intelligence provided to Congress was partially unreliable, and the subsequent problems faced after [[Saddam Hussein]] was deposed, Engel has come to regret his decision to support the invasion, and consistently votes in favor of gradual withdrawal. He has met with anti-war activists, and in 2008, he publicly called for the closing of the [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]]. Engel received an "A" grade from the Iraq and Afghanistan War Veterans in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.votesmart.org/issue_rating_detail.php?r_id=4227 |title=Project Vote Smart - Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America Rating |publisher=Votesmart.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref>

====Irish affairs====
In 2007, Engel became a Co-Chair of the Congressional Ad Hoc Committee on Irish Affairs. He supported the 1998 [[Good Friday Agreement]], and aided Irish nationals facing deportation from the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=hr109-744 |title=H.

Engel was instrumental in helping Joe Byrne return to the [[United States]], after a bureaucratic problem left him detained in Ireland and separated from his family in [[Rockland County]]

====Human rights====
As a member of the [[Congressional Human Rights Caucus]], Engel has supported [[Albanian-Americans]] and ethnic [[Albanians in Kosovo|Albanians]] in [[Kosovo]]. He is co-author of the [[Harkin-Engel Protocol]], along with Senator [[Tom Harkin]] (D-IA), which addresses [[child labor]] in the cocoa fields of [[West Africa]].

In early 2001, he wrote the House resolution condemning the [[Taliban]] for forcing [[Hindu]] citizens to wear distinguishing marks as reminiscent of the [[Nazis]] forcing [[Jews]] to wear a yellow [[Star of David]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/2001/05/25/stories/0125000f.htm |title=The Hindu : Review decree, U.N. officials tell Taliban |publisher=Hinduonnet.com |date=2001-05-25 |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref> In 2008, he wrote a resolution commending the U.S.-Brazil Joint Action Plan to Promote Racial and Ethnic Equality.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://politics4all.com/us/congress/110/bills/HRES1254 |title=HRES1254 - Supporting the values and goals of the "Joint Action Plan Between the Government of the Federative Republic of Brazil and the Government of the United States of America to Eliminate Racial and Ethnic Discrimination and Promote Equality", signed b… |publisher=Politics4all.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref>

Engel sponsored a bill to support the [[Day of Silence]], during which students vow to remain silent to bring attention to the harassment and discrimination faced by [[lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender]] people in schools.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dayofsilence.org/content/history.html |title=Get Information - History |publisher=Day Of Silence |date=2002-04-10 |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref> That bill has been re-submitted in the [[111th United States Congress]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.glsen.org/cgi-bin/iowa/all/news/record/2397.html |title=Day of Silence Resolution Introduced in Congress |publisher=Glsen.org |date=2009-04-02 |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref> He also voted against the [[Defense of Marriage Act]] (DOMA), which allowed for states not to be required to recognize same-sex marriages in other states.<ref>https://www.votesmart.org/issue_keyvote_member.php?cs_id=8013?q=print</ref> In 2010, he voted in 2010 to repeal the "[[Don't Ask, Don't Tell]]" policy, enabling homosexuals to serve [[Coming out|openly]] in the U.S. Military.

====Iran nuclear deal====
In August 2015, Engel announced that, along with fellow Jewish lawmaker Senator [[Charles Schumer]], he would oppose the [[Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action]] Iran nuclear deal in congress, saying that, "The answers I’ve received simply don’t convince me that this deal will keep a nuclear weapon out of Iran’s hands, and may in fact strengthen Iran’s position as a destabilizing and destructive influence across the Middle East."<ref>http://engel.house.gov/latest-news1/engel-statement-on-iran-deal1/</ref>

==Controversies==
Engel was criticized<ref name=River>{{cite news | url=http://www.riverdalepress.com/full.php?sid=4764&current_edition=2008-06-05 | title=Engel taking heat| publisher=The Riverdale Press | date= June 5, 2008 | accessdate = 2008-07-23}}</ref> for choosing to attend a July 2008 event hosted by the controversial pastor [[John Hagee]], who has suggested that God sent [[Adolf Hitler]] to bring the Jews to [[Israel]].<ref name=TJW>{{cite news | url=http://thejewishweek.com/viewArticle/c41_a13013/News/Short_Takes.html | title=Lieberman: Hagee Still Like Moses| publisher=[[The Jewish Week]] | date= July 23, 2008 | first=James| last=Besser| accessdate = 2008-07-23}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

In March 2009, the AP reported that Engel had been taking an annual tax credit on his Maryland residence for at least ten years, despite the fact that the credit is reserved for people who declare Maryland their primary residence. Engel ran for reelection in the Bronx at least five times while claiming a primary residence credit in Maryland, during which time he received "thousands of dollars" in tax credits. Maryland officials revoked the tax credit.<ref name=NYT>{{cite news | url=
http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/14/nyregion/14engel.html?ref=nyregion | title=Bronx Representative Loses a Tax Break| newspaper=The New York Times | date= March 13, 2009 | accessdate = 2009-03-22}}</ref> ''The Washington Post'' reported that the matter was reviewed by the Office of Congressional Ethics in August, 2009, and that the Office was "[e]xpecting OCE notice of termination" for Engel."<ref>{{cite news | url= http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/10/30/AR2009103001391.html?hpid=topnews | title = Ethics office reviewed tax records of four House members| newspaper= The Washington Post | date=October 30, 2009 | accessdate = 2009-11-08}}</ref> The OCE eventually ended its review on Engel, and Reps. [[Doris Matsui]] and [[Edolphus Towns]], without recommending further investigation by the ethics committee.<ref>{{cite web|last=Crabtree |first=Susan |url=http://thehill.com/homenews/house/78607-stark-cleared-by-ethics-committee-over-tax-credit- |title=Calif. lawmaker cleared by ethics panel over tax credit for Maryland home |publisher=TheHill.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref>

Publisher Christopher Hagedorn has often used his Bronx weekly newspapers, the ''Bronx News'', the ''Parkchester News'', and the ''Co-op City News'', to attack Engel.<ref name="columbia.edu">[http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bb/citynews.html "Hagedorn Takes No Prisoners In Co-op City War of Words" Bronx Beat On-line (published by students of the Columbia School of Journalism) (December 11, 1995)]</ref> Hagedorn believes that Engel, when he was still an assemblyman, was behind a failed effort in 1988 to evict the Co-op City News from its offices in Co-op City.<ref>{{cite news |author=Jennifer A. Kingston |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/02/nyregion/co-op-city-ends-lease-of-hard-hitting-paper.html |title=Co-op City Ends Lease of Hard-Hitting Paper |newspaper=The New York Times |date=April 2, 1988 |accessdate=January 7, 2014}}</ref> Since 1988, Hagedorn has published numerous editorials and articles attacking Engel and even reprinted critical articles about him that have been published in other newspapers. Hagedorn has often endorsed Engel's opponents in the Democratic primary and the general election but the Congressman always won re-election to Congress. In 2000, Hagedorn intensified his campaign against Engel when the leadership of the powerful Bronx County Democratic organization decided to support former Assemblyman and City Councilman Larry Seabrook in the primary against Engel.<ref>{{cite news |author=Jonathan P. Hicks |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/08/nyregion/vitriol-flows-race-for-congress-accusations-overshadow-issues-bronx-contest.html?pagewanted=all |title=Vitritol Flows in Race for Congress; Accusations Overshadow Issues in Bronx Contest |newspaper=The New York Times |date=September 8, 2000 |accessdate=January 7, 2014}}</ref> Seabrook, whose campaign was plagued with problems, lost the primary to Engel by a wide margin.

Engel has mostly ignored Hagedorn's attacks. In 1995, however, his then-communications director Greg Howard, told the Bronx Beat newspaper, which wrote about the feud, "We don't consider Mr. Hagedorn a legitimate journalist. He uses the paper as his own personal platform for whatever agenda he has. He chooses the paper to malign people with whom he has philosophical differences."<ref name="columbia.edu"/> In the last decade, Hagedorn's newspapers have mostly ignored Engel.

==Grades and recognition==
Engel received an "A" on the [[Drum Major Institute]]'s 2005<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drummajorinstitute.com/congress/drum-major-voting-summary.php?name=Engel&state=NY&database=house |title=Congress at the Midterm: Their 2005 Middle-Class Record |publisher=Drummajorinstitute.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref> Congressional Scorecard on middle-class issues.

In 1998, as a response to Engel's work in [[Albania]] and [[Kosovo]], the [[Italian government]] presented him, and his then-Administrative Assistant John Calvelli, with a ceremonial knighthood<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.niaf.org/about/board_officers.asp?print=1& |title=NIAF Board Officers |publisher=Niaf.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref> for his work in promoting United States-Italian ties. Ambassador Fernando Salleo issued the knighthood and Italian Consular General in New York Antonio Bandini performed the ceremony.

He was honored in 2008 by the [[American Farm Bureau Federation]] and the New York Farm Bureau as a "Friend of the Farm Bureau" for his support of farm issues during the [[110th United States Congress]].<ref>http://www.fb.org/newsroom/fbn/2008/FBN_09-08-08.pdf</ref> He received an "A" on the [[Drum Major Institute]]'s Congressional Scorecards in 2005 and 2008 for supporting middle-class issues.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drummajorinstitute.org/library/article.php?ID=6467 |title=Press Release from office of Congressman Engel |publisher=Drummajorinstitute.org |date=2006-06-29 |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref> Engel has had a nearly 100% rating from the [[AFL-CIO]] over his entire legislative career.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.votesmart.org/issue_rating_detail.php?r_id=3202 |title=Project Vote Smart - AFL-CIO Rating |publisher=Votesmart.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref>
