'''David Bennett McKinley''' (born March 28, 1947) is an [[United States|American]] politician who has been the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|WV|1}} since 2011. He is a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. McKinley was a member of the [[West Virginia House of Delegates]] from 1981–94, and he was Chairman of the [[West Virginia Republican Party]] from 1990-94.

==Early life, education, and business career==
After graduating with his [[B.S. degree]] in engineering from [[Purdue University]], McKinley worked as a [[civil engineer]] for 12 years until founding his own firm, McKinley and Associates, based in [[Wheeling, West Virginia|Wheeling]]. The 40-member firm has been involved in $1 billion in construction projects over the past 30 years. Many of McKinley's projects have been government-funded, which has made for an uneasy peace between McKinley and his 'tea-party' constituents.<ref name="Past Projects">{{cite web|title=Past Projects |url=http://www.mckinleyassoc.com/pages2/portfolio/index.htm |publisher=McKinley & Associates |accessdate=December 29, 2012 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6DHLZknDH?url=http://www.mckinleyassoc.com/pages2/portfolio/index.htm |archivedate=December 29, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref>

McKinley has renovated structures of historic significance in West Virginia communities such as the [[Capitol Theatre (Wheeling, West Virginia)|Capitol Theatre]] in Wheeling. The venue for years was home to the legendary [[WWVA Jamboree|Jamboree, USA]].<ref name="mckinley.house.gov">{{cite web|url=http://mckinley.house.gov/about-me/full-biography|accessdate=January 11, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110113091948/http://mckinley.house.gov/about-me/full-biography|title=David McKinley profile|archivedate=January 13, 2011}}</ref>

From 1990-94, he was chairman of the [[West Virginia Republican Party]]. As chairman, he was very critical of West Virginia's two [[Democratic Party (US)|Democratic]] senators. In 1991, he criticized U.S. Senator [[Jay Rockefeller]] for running for president against President [[George H. W. Bush]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xHdDAAAAIBAJ&sjid=PakMAAAAIBAJ&pg=1225,2613126&dq=david+mckinley+west+virginia&hl=en|title=Point Pleasant Register|publisher=News.google.com|accessdate=January 8, 2015}}</ref>

===Tenure===
McKinley has broken ranks with the Republican majority a few times in his tenure in Congress. In April 2011, McKinley was one of only four Republican members of Congress to vote against the [[The Path to Prosperity|Republican budget proposal]] of 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2011/roll277.xml|title=Final vote results for roll call 277|publisher=Clerk of the House of Representatives|date=2011-04-15|author=|accessdate=2011-04-23}}</ref> He explained "As it relates to the Medicare, I applaud what Paul Ryan was trying to do, because we need to have an adult conversation about it. The [[Congressional Budget Office]] determined that some of the out-of-pocket costs could double for seniors and that sent up a red flag for me that we need to look at it."{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

In October 2011, he was the only Republican to vote against all three of the trade deals passed by Congress: [[Panama–United States Trade Promotion Agreement|Panama]], [[United States–Colombia Free Trade Agreement|Colombia]], and [[South Korea–United States Free Trade Agreement|South Korea]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollcall.com/issues/57_42/Trade-Votes-Signal-GOP-Evolution-209511-1.html?zkMobileView=true|title=Trade Votes Signal GOP Evolution|publisher=Rollcall.com|accessdate=January 8, 2015}}</ref> He said “Free trade deals like [[NAFTA]] and [[CAFTA]] have been nothing more than broken promises that shipped our jobs overseas, and I won’t vote for any free trade agreements unless they’re fair to my constituents.”<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/188071-tea-party-buys-in-to-trade|title=Tea Party buys in to trade|author=Kevin Bogardus|work=TheHill|accessdate=January 8, 2015}}</ref>

McKinley has expressed concern over the "unchecked spending" of the United States, which he says results in us being "beholden to countries like China and Japan who own a significant amount of our debt."<ref name="Election Profile">{{cite web|title=Election Candidate Profile|url=http://electioncandidates.com/davidmckinley/profile|publisher=Election Candidates|accessdate=July 27, 2012}}</ref>

;Jobs
McKinley is an active supporter of the Coal Miner Employment and Domestic Energy Infrastructure Protection Act. Also known as the Stop the War on Coal Act, fights to protect American jobs and prevents against future legislation from being passed that would reduce mining jobs. McKinley believes, "The constant attacks on coal have to stop." <ref>{{cite web|url=http://mckinley.house.gov/press-releases/rep-mckinley-responds-to-consol-layoffs-due-to-epa-permit-delays|title=Congressman David McKinley|publisher=Mckinley.house.gov|accessdate=January 8, 2015}}</ref>

McKinley was one of 233 representatives who were in favor of the act that passed earlier this year in September 2012. McKinley stated, “Our job creators need a consistent and predictable regulatory program that will protect jobs we have and create new one.”<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov|title=Congress.gov|publisher=Thomas.loc.gov|accessdate=January 8, 2015}}</ref>

;Gun Control
McKinley is a strong supporter of the notion that people should be allowed to carry a concealed weapon. McKinley has been consistent in his voting patterns regarding gun control and continued this trend when voting yes to Requiring State Reciprocity for Carrying Concealed Firearms. He received an “A” rating from the [[National Rifle Association]]. In 2012 the NRA is one of McKinley’s main endorsers.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

;Abortion Issue
McKinley is a supporter of the Pro-Life movement. He believes, "The use of federal funds to pay for ending the life of an unborn child is appalling.”  Since he contains this set of beliefs he voted for the passing of the District of Columbia Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act in July 2012, which did not pass. This act would prohibit an abortion in the District of Columbia. McKinley consistently votes in support of the Pro-Life movement. Therefore, the National Right to Life Committee gave McKinley an “A” rating for his constant support from 2011 to the present.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

;Climate Change
In May 2014, McKinley offered an amendment to the [[Howard P. "Buck" McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 (H.R. 4435; 113th Congress)|Howard P. "Buck" McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015]] that bars the Department of Defense from using funds to assess climate change and its implications for national security.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/23/pentagon-climate-change_n_5382067.html|title=House Directs Pentagon To Ignore Climate Change|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=January 8, 2015}}</ref> This despite a Department of Defense report that found that climate change impacts are threat multipliers, and that the rapid rise of global temperatures and associated extreme weather events could "exacerbate conditions that enable terrorist activity and other forms of violence." The amendment passed on a near party-line vote.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

On May 23, 2013, McKinley introduced the [[Better Buildings Act of 2014 (H.R. 2126; 113th Congress)]] into the [[United States House of Representatives]]. The bill would amend federal law aimed at improving the [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] of commercial office buildings.<ref name=cbo2126>{{cite web|title=CBO – H.R. 2126|url=http://cbo.gov/publication/45127|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=March 3, 2014}}</ref> The bill would create a program called "Tenant Star" similar to the existing [[Energy Star]] program.<ref name=usgbc1>{{cite web|last=Howard|first=Bryan|title=House committee clears important legislation for commercial tenants|url=http://www.usgbc.org/articles/house-committee-clears-important-legislation-commercial-tenants|publisher=U.S. Green Building Council|accessdate=March 4, 2014|date=January 30, 2014}}</ref> He argued in favor of the bill, saying that "finding ways to use energy efficiently is common sense.
