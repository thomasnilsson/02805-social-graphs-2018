;2006
{{Main article|United States House of Representatives elections in Texas, 2006}}
In 2006, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] threw out the 23rd District in ''[[League of United Latin American Citizens v. Perry]]'' on the grounds that it violated the rights of Latino voters.  The 23rd is the largest district in the nation (not counting the at-large districts), stretching across 800 road miles from [[El Paso]] to San Antonio.  Due to its size, nearly every district in the El Paso-San Antonio corridor had to be redrawn.  Smith regained most of the Hill Country, but kept a large portion of his share of Austin, including the area around the University of Texas.

In November 2006 the Texas Legislative Council <ref name="SAEN-2-8-06">Gary Martin, [http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/metro/stories/MYSA020806.en.POLcourage.bush.a7b1b44.html "Courage, other veterans speak out against Bush"], ''San Antonio Express-News'', February 8, 2006. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929100034/http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/metro/stories/MYSA020806.en.POLcourage.bush.a7b1b44.html |date=September 29, 2007 }}</ref> found that nearly two-thirds of voters in District 21 cast ballots for statewide Republican candidates in 2004.

;Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA)
On April 23, 2006 [[CNET]] reported that Smith was introducing a bill that "would expand the DMCA's restrictions on software that can bypass copy protections and grant federal police more wiretapping and enforcement powers".<ref>Declan McCullagh , [http://news.cnet.com/2100-1028_3-6064016.html?part=rss&tag=6064016&subj=news "Congress readies broad new digital copyright bill"], [[CNET]], April 24, 2006.</ref> The move sparked a negative response among technology enthusiasts in opposition to the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]].

;Ending Federal Marijuana Prohibition Act of 2011
On June 23, 2011, H.R. 2306 was introduced to Congress by [[Barney Frank]] and co-signer [[Ron Paul]].<ref>[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h112-2306 H.R. 2306: Ending Federal Marijuana Prohibition Act of 2011]. GovTrack.us. Retrieved on 2011-11-16.</ref> The intent of the bill was to end the Federal prohibition on [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], turning over the regulation of [[marijuana]] to states (similar to alcohol). The bill was the first of its kind since prohibition began. H.R. 2306 would limit federal powers to interstate transfer; while laws for cultivation, sales, use, and taxation would be determined by each state. This bill was well received by the public, especially [[medical marijuana]] patients and activists.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Lamar Smith informed reporters that he had no intention of considering the bill or providing it with a hearing. With Smith's position as chairman of the [[House Committee on the Judiciary]], he has great influence on what bills will be considered.

Smith stated that "Marijuana use and distribution is prohibited under federal law because it has a high potential for abuse and does not have an accepted medical use in the U.S., The [[Food and Drug Administration]] has not approved smoked marijuana for any condition or disease".<ref name=latimes>[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2011/06/marijuana-bill-officially-introduced-to-congress-by-ron-paul-barney-frank.html "Marijuana bill officially introduced to Congress by Ron Paul, Barney Frank"], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', 23 June 2011, Retrieved on 2012-01-09.</ref> 
Smith also stated that "Decriminalizing marijuana will only lead to millions more Americans becoming addicted to drugs and greater profits for drug cartels who fund violence along the U.S.-Mexico border.  Allowing states to determine their own marijuana policy flies in the face of Supreme Court precedent".<ref name=latimes/>

On June 24, 2011, Lamar Smith's [[Facebook]] page was flooded with protests from citizens, asking him to change his position on the bill and calling for a fair hearing. Smith's Facebook page was temporarily taken down soon after, to be returned void of all comments related to H.R. 2306 and with future comments disabled.<ref name=norml>[http://blog.norml.org/2011/06/24/reefer-madness-alive-and-well-in-the-federal-government/ "Reefer Madness: Alive And Well In The Federal Government!"], [[NORML]] blog, (2011-06-24). Retrieved on 2012-1-26.</ref>
The National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws ([[NORML]]) encouraged MMJ patients and activists to contact Smith via his phone, which was soon turned to an automatic answering machine, stating the office was closed.<ref name=norml/>
