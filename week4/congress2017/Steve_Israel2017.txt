Since redistricting in 2012, the district includes portions of northern [[Nassau County, New York|Nassau]] and [[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk]] counties on [[Long Island]], as well as a minuscule portion of [[Queens]] in [[New York City]].  He is a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and was head of the [[Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee]] until November 2014. Before serving in Congress, he served on the  [[Huntington, New York]] town board.

==Early life, education, and career==
Israel was born in [[Brooklyn]] borough of [[New York City]], New York,<ref name=wapo-profile>{{cite web | url= http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/members/I000057/ | title=Steve Israel (D) | publisher= The U.S. Congress Votes Database (''[[The Washington Post]]'') | accessdate= November 10, 2016| archivedate= May 3, 2016| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160503070325/http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/members/I000057/| deadurl=no}}</ref> and raised in the [[Long Island]] community of [[Levittown, New York]].<ref name=official-biography />  He attended [[Nassau Community College]] and graduated from [[Syracuse University]] in 1979 with a bachelor of arts degree.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
After [[Rick Lazio]] left his House seat to run for the [[United States Senate]] in 2000, Israel was elected to his seat, receiving 48% of the vote, defeating Republican Joan Jonhson, who received 34%, and four independent candidates.<ref>http://www.elections.ny.gov/NYSBOE/elections/2000/wcon2000.pdf</ref> He has been reelected six times with relatively little difficulty, despite representing a swing district on paper.

On January 5, 2016, Israel announced that he would not seek reelection in November 2016.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/06/us/politics/steve-israel-house-democrat-new-york.html?_r=0 | title=Steve Israel of New York, a Top House Democrat, Won’t Seek Re-election | work=New York Times | date=5 January 2016 | accessdate=4 April 2016 | author=Hulse, Carl}}</ref>

** [[United States House Appropriations Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs|Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs]]
** [[United States House Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies|Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies]]

===Caucus membership===

* House Cancer Caucus (Co-chair)
* Long Island Sound Caucus (Co-chair)

In his second term, Israel was tapped for a leadership position as Assistant [[Whip (politics)|Whip]]. In his third term, Israel was appointed to chair the House Democratic Caucus Task Force on Defense and Military, a group of 15 Democrat House members who reach out to the defense community and advise the House Democratic leadership on military policy. In 2006 Israel harshly criticized [[Jimmy Carter]] for his book [[Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid]], and at the same time criticized the Palestinian government.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.forward.com/articles/carter-book-slaps-israel-with-%E2%80%98apartheid%E2%80%99-tag/ |title=– The Jewish Daily Forward |publisher=Forward.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211001752/http://www.forward.com/articles/carter-book-slaps-israel-with-%E2%80%98apartheid%E2%80%99-tag/ |archivedate=February 11, 2009 }}</ref>

;Occupy Wall Street
Israel's support for [[Occupy Wall Street]] drew criticism from conservatives, who claimed the movement harbored "anti-Semitic" elements. In response Israel pointed to his support for the nation of Israel as well as his own Jewish heritage.<ref name="OWS anti-Semitism">{{cite news|title=Steve Israel Furious At Republican Charge That He Embraces Anti-Semitism In Occupy Wall Street|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/10/20/steve-israel-anti-semitism-occupy-wall-street-republican-charge_n_1022579.html|newspaper=The Huffington Post|date=20 October 2011|first=Michael|last=McAuliff}}</ref>

===DCCC chairman===
As an ally of [[Nancy Pelosi]], Israel was mentioned in 2010 as a possible successor to [[Chris Van Hollen]], the chairman of the DCCC; he declined to speak about it until after the midterms were over, saying he was "just completely focused on supporting Nancy Pelosi."<ref name="To Chair Campaign Arm">{{cite news|title=Steve Israel to Chair Democratic Campaign Arm|url=http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2010/11/steve-israel-to-chair-democratic-campaign-arm/66840/|newspaper=The Atlantic|date=19 November 2010}}</ref>

It was reported that Pelosi's selection of Israel to head the DCCC had much to do with the district he represents, where "Democrats hold a modest registration edge but independents decide elections." It was noted that Israel had gained respect through fundraising and recruiting candidates for the campaign committee. Israel is one of the few Democrats who has run campaign ads in defense of his vote on health care.<ref name="Uphill Charge">{{cite news|title=L.I. Congressman Leads Uphill Charge Toward a Democratic House|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/19/nyregion/19steveisrael.html?_r=1&pagewanted=all|newspaper=The New York Times|date=18 March 2011|first=David M.|last=Halbfinger}}</ref>

==Policy positions==

===Abortion===
Israel has said he supports legal abortions in cases of rape, incest, and threat to the life of the mother, though he does not support abortions being legal in all cases.<ref name="votesmart.org">{{cite web|url=http://votesmart.org/candidate/political-courage-test/55440/steve-israel |title=Steve Israel - Political Positions - - Project Vote Smart |publisher=Votesmart.org |date= |accessdate=May 21, 2013}}</ref> He has voted against bills that would prohibit federal funding for abortions, against a bill that would eliminate federal funding for [[Planned Parenthood]], an organization that provides abortions, and against the Abortion Pain Act, which would have prevented abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy. Since 2004 he has consistently received 100% ratings from the pro-choice groups [[NARAL]], Planned Parenthood, and the National Family Planning & Reproductive Health Association, as well as a 0% rating from the [[National Right to Life Committee]].

===Gun issues===
Rep. Israel supports increased regulation on gun ownership. He voted against several bills and amendments which would decrease federal regulation of safety precautions of guns and decrease federal regulations on the sale of firearms. He also cosponsored the 2009 “No Fly, No Buy” Act,<ref>{{cite web|author=Rep. Carolyn McCarthy [D-NY4] |url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/111/hr2401 |title=No Fly, No Buy Act of 2009 (2009; 111th Congress H.R. 2401) |publisher=GovTrack.us |date= |accessdate=May 21, 2013}}</ref> stating “Gun safety measures like the 'No Fly, No Buy' Act should be a no-brainer for every member of Congress.

===Health care===

Steve Israel voted for the 2010 [[Affordable Care Act]],<ref>http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2010/roll165.xml</ref> and against several bills repealing it.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

===LGBT rights===
Israel supports same-sex marriage. In a press release in June 2009, he said, “I’m proud of what Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Connecticut and Vermont have done for marriage equality. I hope that my home state of New York will soon follow.” <ref>{{cite web|url=http://israel.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=689%3Acounting-marriage-equality&catid=49%3Ablog&Itemid=1 |title=Counting Marriage Equality |publisher=Israel.house.gov |date=June 17, 2009 |accessdate=May 21, 2013}}</ref> [[Same-sex marriage in New York|New York legalized same-sex marriage]] in 2011.

He voted for the repeal of [[Don't ask, don't tell]], and for the [[Employment Non-Discrimination Act]].<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

He has a 100% rating from the pro-LGBT rights [[Human Rights Campaign]] and a 0% rating from the [[Family Research Council]].<ref name="votesmart.org"/>

==J Street controversy==
Steve Israel was an honorary member of the gala host committee for a Gala dinner on October 27, 2009 by [[J Street]], a [[Liberalism|liberal]],<ref name="Abramowitz2008-04-15">{{cite news|first=Michael|last=Abramowitz|authorlink=|url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/04/14/AR2008041402647.html|title= Jewish Liberals to Launch A Counterpoint to AIPAC|publisher= The Washington Post|location =|date=April 15, 2008|accessdate=April 29, 2008}}</ref><ref name="Eggen">{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/04/16/AR2009041603995.html |work=The Washington Post |title=Year-Old Liberal Jewish Lobby Has Quickly Made Its Mark |first=Dan |last=Eggen |date=April 17, 2009 |accessdate=May 5, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/washington/articles/2010/02/27/delahunts_journey_to_mideast_upended/ | work=Boston.com | title=Delahunt’s journey to Mideast upended| first=Farah | last=Stockton | date=February 27, 2010 | accessdate=September 22, 2010}}</ref> nonprofit lobbying group. In the weeks leading up to the Gala dinner, those aligned with the [[Likud]], the political party of [[Prime Minister of Israel|Israeli Prime Minister]], [[Benjamin Netanyahu]], criticized Rep. Israel and those supporting J Street. ''[[The Weekly Standard]]'' blogger [[Michael Goldfarb (political writer)|Michael Goldfarb]] called the J Street dinner an "anti-Israel bash."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/10/24/AR2009102400994.html | work=The Washington Post | title=Israel conference to open amid controversy | first=Dan | last=Eggen | date=October 25, 2009 | accessdate=May 24, 2010}}</ref> In response Rep. Israel's spokeswoman Lindsay Hamilton said, "It's absurd that this has become a controversy...The Congressman agreed to be on the gala host committee. That doesn't mean he agrees with every viewpoint of every speaker at the event".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/LandedPages/PrintArticle.aspx?id=158056 |title=Michael Oren rejects J Street conference invite |publisher=Jpost.com |date= |accessdate=May 21, 2013}}</ref>

==Electoral history==
New York election law allows for [[fusion voting]], where a candidate can run as a member of multiple parties. In 2000 Israel ran only as a Democrat in his winning bid for Congress, but since 2002 he has also run as the candidate for the [[Independence Party of New York|Independence Party]] and the [[Working Families Party]]. In 2000 the Republican candidate ran only as a Republican, but since 2002, every Republican has also run as the candidate for the [[Conservative Party of New York]].

In his third term, Israel was appointed to chair the House Democratic Caucus Task Force on Defense and Military, a group of 15 Democrat House members who reach out to the defense community and advise the House Democratic leadership on military policy. In 2006 Israel harshly criticized [[Jimmy Carter]] for his book [[Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid]], and at the same time criticized the Palestinian government.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.forward.com/articles/carter-book-slaps-israel-with-%E2%80%98apartheid%E2%80%99-tag/ |title=– The Jewish Daily Forward |publisher=Forward.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211001752/http://www.forward.com/articles/carter-book-slaps-israel-with-%E2%80%98apartheid%E2%80%99-tag/ |archivedate=February 11, 2009 }}</ref>

;Occupy Wall Street
Israel's support for [[Occupy Wall Street]] drew criticism from conservatives, who claimed the movement harbored "anti-Semitic" elements. In response Israel pointed to his support for the nation of Israel as well as his own Jewish heritage.<ref name="OWS anti-Semitism">{{cite news|title=Steve Israel Furious At Republican Charge That He Embraces Anti-Semitism In Occupy Wall Street|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/10/20/steve-israel-anti-semitism-occupy-wall-street-republican-charge_n_1022579.html|newspaper=The Huffington Post|date=20 October 2011|first=Michael|last=McAuliff}}</ref>

===DCCC chairman===
As an ally of [[Nancy Pelosi]], Israel was mentioned in 2010 as a possible successor to [[Chris Van Hollen]], the chairman of the DCCC; he declined to speak about it until after the midterms were over, saying he was "just completely focused on supporting Nancy Pelosi."<ref name="To Chair Campaign Arm">{{cite news|title=Steve Israel to Chair Democratic Campaign Arm|url=http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2010/11/steve-israel-to-chair-democratic-campaign-arm/66840/|newspaper=The Atlantic|date=19 November 2010}}</ref>

It was reported that Pelosi's selection of Israel to head the DCCC had much to do with the district he represents, where "Democrats hold a modest registration edge but independents decide elections." It was noted that Israel had gained respect through fundraising and recruiting candidates for the campaign committee. Israel is one of the few Democrats who has run campaign ads in defense of his vote on health care.<ref name="Uphill Charge">{{cite news|title=L.I.

==Electoral history==
New York election law allows for [[fusion voting]], where a candidate can run as a member of multiple parties. In 2000 Israel ran only as a Democrat in his winning bid for Congress, but since 2002 he has also run as the candidate for the [[Independence Party of New York|Independence Party]] and the [[Working Families Party]]. In 2000 the Republican candidate ran only as a Republican, but since 2002, every Republican has also run as the candidate for the [[Conservative Party of New York]].
