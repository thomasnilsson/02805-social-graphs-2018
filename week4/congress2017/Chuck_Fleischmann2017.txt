===Elections===
;2010
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Tennessee, 2010#District 3}}
Republican incumbent [[Zach Wamp]] decided to retire in order to run for Governor, leaving this an open seat. Fleischmann entered a crowded 11-way Republican primary—the real contest in this heavily Republican district.  None of the candidates had ever run for elected office before.  Fleischmann's biggest competition came from former state GOP chairwoman Robin Smith.<ref>{{cite news |title=AP Analysis: Command eludes TN GOP conservatives |work=Washington Examiner |url=http://washingtonexaminer.com/news/nation/2010/11/ap-analysis-command-eludes-tn-gop-conservatives |first=ERIK |last=SCHELZIG |date=2010-11-21 |agency=Associated Press}}</ref> She was endorsed by former [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the U.S. House]] [[Newt Gingrich]] and [[The Club for Growth]]. Fleischmann won the primary with a plurality of 30% of the vote. He defeated second-place finisher Smith by 1,415 votes. He won most of the counties in the district, which were mostly in the northern part of the district, while Smith won three counties: [[Rhea County, Tennessee|Rhea]], [[Hamilton County, Tennessee|Hamilton]] (home to Chattanooga), and [[Polk County, Tennessee|Polk]] counties. Third place finisher Tim Gobble won only single county: [[Bradley County, Tennessee|Bradley]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=555629 |title=TN – District 03 – R Primary Race – Aug 05, 2010 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2013-08-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tennessee.gov/sos/election/results/Rep%20GovUSHouseTotal.pdf |title=Republican Primary Unofficial Results |work=Tennessee Election Commission website |accessdate=August 6, 2010}}</ref>

His Democratic opponent in the general election was John Wolfe, a fellow attorney.  Fleischmann faced Wolfe in his first case as an attorney.  He said he won that case and the appeal "and now I want to defeat him a third time."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.chattanoogan.com/articles/article_182946.asp |title=Fleischmann Says First Aim Is To "Say Goodby To Nancy Pelosi" |work=Chattanoogan.com |date=August 30, 2010}}</ref> His other opponent was independent candidate Savas Kyriakidis, an attorney, restaurant owner and Iraq War veteran.<ref>{{cite news |date=2010-11-07 |title=Tea party activity leaves some Republicans bitter |url=http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/2010/nov/07/tea-party-activity-leaves-some-republicans-bitter/?local |work=Chattanooga Times Free Press |first=Cliff |last=Hightower}}</ref> Fleischmann won the race with 57% of the vote.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.myfoxmemphis.com/dpp/news/local/110310-results-summary-of-tennessee-races |title=Election Results Summary of Tennessee Races |date=2010-11-03 |work=MyFox Memphis}}</ref>

For his first re-election campaign, Fleischmann defeated [[Scottie Mayfield]] and [[Weston Wamp]] in the Republican primary, 39%-31%-29%.<ref>{{cite news|last=Miller|first=Joshua|title=Tennessee: Chuck Fleischmann Wins Primary|url=http://atr.rollcall.com/tennessee-chuck-fleischmann-wins-primary/|accessdate=8 August 2012|newspaper=Roll Call|date=August 2, 2012}}</ref> He faced Democrat Mary Headrick in the general election of November 2012 and won with a large majority of the vote.<ref>{{cite news|last=Carroll|first=Chris|title=Chuck Fleischmann fends off GOP challengers|url=http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/2012/aug/03/first-term-congressman-fends-off-gop/|accessdate=8 August 2012|newspaper=Times Free Press|date=August 3, 2012}}</ref>

===Tenure===
Rep. Fleischmann has always been a firm opponent of gun control. He has received an “A” rating from the interest groups "National Rifle Association Political Fund Positions on Gun Rights" and "Gun Owners of America Positions on Gun Rights". He supports legislation that “allows licensed firearm owners to carry out their God-given right more freely” because “the right to carry a firearm is a right that allows law-abiding citizens to protect themselves and is crucial to the freedom of our country.” On November 16, 2011 Fleischmann voted Yea on the “National Right-to-Carry Reciprocity Act of 2011, which would allow a resident of a state that allows concealed carry to possess a firearm while visiting another state that has different firearm laws.

Rep. Fleischmann’s first vote in office was the 2011 motion “Repealing the Health Care Bill” which he supported.

In July 2011, Fleischmann originally supported Speaker [[John Boehner]]’s debt limit bill, but he voted against the final debt ceiling agreement.<ref>{{cite news |title=John Boehner to attend Chuck Fleischmann event |date=October 5, 2011 |author=Chris Carroll |work=Chattanooga Times Free Press |url=http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/2011/oct/05/boehner-to-attend-fleischmann-event/}}</ref>

On November 16th 2011 Fleischmann voted for a bill that encourages the display of “In God We Trust” in public buildings and schools and reinforces it as our nation’s motto.

In November 2011 Rep. Fleischmann filed a new bill called the “Stop Green Initiative Abuse Act of 2011” which would repeal the Department of Energy’s “Weatherization Assistance Program”. This program attempts to assist low-income families in lowering their energy bills by adding energy efficient caulking and insulation to homes. A December 2010 report from the Tennessee Comptroller’s Office concluded that funds for the program had been “wasted or misspent”. Fleischmann’s office estimates that if this bill passes it would save taxpayers $2.1 billion over the next decade. This is the third bill he has proposed.
