From June 2002 to December 2004, Griffin was Research Director and Deputy Communications Director for [[George W. Bush presidential campaign, 2004|Bush's 2004 reelection campaign]], a high-ranking position within the RNC.

In June 2007, Senators [[Edward Kennedy]] and [[Sheldon Whitehouse]] asked the [[U.S. Justice Department]] to investigate whether Griffin led a [[Republican National Committee]] effort to suppress the African-American vote in [[Jacksonville, Florida]] through [[Caging (voter suppression)|caging]] during the 2004 election. Griffin called the allegations of voter suppression "absolutely, positively false" and there was no finding of any wrongdoing.<ref>{{cite news|last=Rushing|first=J.

In September 2006, after ending a one-year military mobilization assignment, Griffin began working as a special assistant to [[Bud Cummins]], [[United States Attorney]] for the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas|Eastern District of Arkansas]].<ref>

On December 15, 2006, the Justice Department announced that Griffin would be appointed interim U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas, effective December 20, 2006, the date when the resignation of Cummins took effect.<ref name='DOJ-Griffin-Announce-2006-12-15'>{{cite web|url=http://justice.gov/usao/are/news_releases/2006/december/12.15.2006.pdf|title=Justice Department Announces Appointment of J.

Before a March 2006 revision to the PATRIOT Act, interim U.S. Attorneys had a 120-day term limit, pending confirmation by the Senate of a Presidential nominee. The Attorney General makes interim appointments; after the revision, the Attorney General's interim appointees had no [[term limits|term limit]], effectively bypassing the Senate confirmation process if the President declined to put forward a nomination. Griffin was among the first group of interim attorneys appointed by the Attorney General without a term limit.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nwanews.com/adg/National/175895|title=Prosecutor post is filled in recess|publisher=[[Arkansas Democrat Gazette]]|date=December 16, 2006|first=Linda|last=Satter|accessdate=2007-04-04|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927235331/http://www.nwanews.com/adg/National/175895|archivedate=2007-09-27}}</ref> Gonzales's decision to bypass confirmation for Griffin particularly angered Arkansas's two U.S. Senators, [[Blanche Lincoln]] and [[Mark Pryor]]. Lincoln and Pryor both stated that Gonzales promised them Griffin would go before the Senate for confirmation. Gonzales's decision not to do so prompted Lincoln and Pryor to join many of their Democratic colleagues in demanding Gonzales's resignation or firing.<ref>[http://www.fox16.com/news/local/story.aspx?content_id=d9cb4ecc-bcf2-4940-9c30-f1847cd09b7e&rss=315 Lincoln, Pryor say Gonzales should be replaced], FOX16.com; accessed November 5, 2014.</ref>

On May 30, 2007, Griffin resigned from his position effective June 1, 2007<ref name='Arkansas-times-Brantley-2007-05-30'>{{cite news|first=Max|last=Brantley|title=It's official|date=May 30, 2007|publisher=The Arkansas Times|url=http://www.arktimes.com/blogs/arkansasblog/2007/05/its_official_4.aspx|work=Arkansas Blog|accessdate=2007-05-31|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070603152724/http://www.arktimes.com/blogs/arkansasblog/2007/05/its_official_4.aspx|archivedate=2007-06-03}}</ref> with a tearful speech declaring that public service "not worth it.

Documents released by a subsequent Congressional investigation showed that, in the summer of 2006, White House officials wanted a vacant slot in Little Rock, Arkansas, so Griffin could fill it. Prior to this, he was a top Republican researcher and aide to Rove.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/03/13/fired.emails|title=E-mails lay out plan to dismiss U.S. attorneys|publisher=CNN|date=March 14, 2007|accessdate=2007-03-12}}</ref> On February 16, 2007, 10 days after McNulty testified that Cummins was dismissed to create a vacancy for Griffin's appointment, Griffin announced he would not seek the presidential nomination to be U.S. attorney in Little Rock.<ref>{{cite news|title=Interim Ark.

In September 2008, the [[United States Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General|Office of the Inspector General]] in the Department of Justice issued a report concluding that Cummins had not been removed for any reasons related to his performance, but rather to make a place for Griffin.<ref>{{Cite web|title=An Investigation into the Removal of Nine U.S. Attorneys in 2006|publisher=[[United States Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General]]|date=September 2008|url=http://www.justice.gov/oig/special/s0809a/chapter5.htm| accessdate=2011-01-06}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Roth|first=Zachary|title=Report Shows White House Engineered U.S. Attorney Firings|publisher=[[Talking Points Memo]]|date=October 1, 2008|url=http://tpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/10/report_shows_white_house_engineered.php|accessdate=2011-01-06}}</ref>
