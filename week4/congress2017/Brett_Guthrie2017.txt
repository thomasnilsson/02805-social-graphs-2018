'''Steven Brett Guthrie''' (born February 18, 1964) is the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|KY|2}}. Located in central Kentucky, the district covers [[Fort Knox]], [[Owensboro]], [[Bowling Green, Kentucky|Bowling Green]] and [[Danville, Kentucky|Danville]]. He has served in that role since 2009. He is a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. He previously served in the [[Kentucky Senate]].

==Early life, education, and career==

Guthrie was born in [[Florence, Alabama|Florence]], [[Alabama]], the son of Carolyn P. (née Holt) and Lowell M. Guthrie.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~battle/reps/guthrie.htm |title=Brett Guthrie ancestry |publisher=Freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-18}}</ref> He earned his [[Bachelor of Science]] in [[mathematical economics]] from the [[U.S. Military Academy at West Point]] in 1987<ref>[http://www.west-point.org/class/usma1987/content/view/181/60/ ''USMA 1987'' article on Guthrie] retrieved 2008 December 31.</ref> and his Master's of Public and Private Management from [[Yale University]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], [[Connecticut]], in 1997.

Guthrie is a former vice president of Trace Die Cast, Inc., an automotive parts supplier based in [[Bowling Green, Kentucky|Bowling Green]]. Guthrie has previously served as a [[field artillery]] officer in the [[101st Airborne Division (United States)|101st Airborne Division]] at [[Fort Campbell, Kentucky|Fort Campbell]], Kentucky.

==Kentucky Senate==
Guthrie represented the 32nd district in the [[Kentucky Senate]] from 1999 to 2008, where he served as vice chairman of the Economic Development, Tourism and Labor Committee, and was chairman of the Transportation Committee.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
;2008
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Kentucky, 2008#District 2}}
In the 2008 congressional [[general election]], he defeated his [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] opponent, State Senator [[David Boswell (Kentucky politician)|David Boswell]], for the right to succeed the retiring Republican [[U.S. Representative]] [[Ron Lewis]]. Lewis announced his retirement on the last day for candidates to file for the seat in 2008, in hopes of steering the Republican nomination to his chief of staff, Daniel London. Guthrie, however, filed his papers and defeated London for the party nomination.

This set up the closest race in the 2nd in 14 years.  While Democrats have a large advantage in registration, they are very conservative on social issues, a major reason Lewis had been able to hold on to the district with little trouble since winning it in a 1994 special election.  Ultimately, Guthrie prevailed by 15,500 votes, mostly on the strength of rural voters. Guthrie may have been boosted by voters being more motivated to come to the polls due to the Presidential election and the Senate election that were held at the same time. Republican candidate [[John McCain]] carried the district with 60 percent of the vote and won all but one county entirely within the district. The incumbent Republican Senator [[Mitch McConnell]] also carried the 2nd district easily.

;2010
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Kentucky, 2010#District 2}}
The 2nd reverted to form in 2010, and Guthrie defeated Democrat Ed Marksberry by a large margin.

;2012
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Kentucky, 2012#District 2}}
Guthrie won reelection in 2012 with over 64% of the vote.

In December 2013, [[Suzanne Miles]], Guthrie's district representative in [[Owensboro, Kentucky|Owensboro]], won a [[special election]] to the 7th District seat in the [[Kentucky House of Representatives]]. She became the 46th Republican member of the chamber, the highest since 1921.<ref>Ryan Alessi, "Republican Suzanne Miles wins House seat from Democrats in another 7th District squeaker", ''cn|2 Pure Politics'', December 10, 2013</ref>

===Tenure===

Based on a questionnaire and the votes that the National Rifle Association Political Victory Fund considered to be the most important in 1998, they assigned Representative Guthrie a grade of B.<ref>[http://www.votesmart.org/issue_rating_category.php?can_id=18829 Project VoteSmart Interest Group ratings] retrieved 2010 May 7.</ref> He has since received A's from the NRA and various other Second Amendment rights advocacy groups. In 2011, Guthrie voted for the [[National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012]] as part of a controversial provision that allows the government and the military to indefinitely detain American citizens and others without trial.<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/ndaa-bill-how-did-your-congress-member-vote-384362 |title=NDAA Bill: How Did Your Congress Member Vote? |publisher=Ibtimes.com |date=2011-12-16 |accessdate=2014-08-18}}</ref> In July 2013, Guthrie voted against the move to defund the National Security Agency due to the alleged privacy violations reported by whistleblower [[Edward Snowden]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/24/amash-amendment-roll-call-vote_n_3648737.html | work=Huffington Post | title=How The House Voted Down Effort To Curb NSA Surveillance | date=July 24, 2013}}</ref>

Guthrie is not particularly affiliated with the [[Tea Party movement]] and unlike the majority of members of his own party voted to end the [[United States federal government shutdown of 2013]].<ref>http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2013/roll550.xml</ref>

==Personal life==
