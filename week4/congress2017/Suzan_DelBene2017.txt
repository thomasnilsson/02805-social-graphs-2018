;2010
{{main article|United States House of Representatives elections in Washington, 2010#District 8}}
in 2010 DelBene ran for election to the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] against the incumbent in the 8th [[Congressional district|Congressional District]], [[Dave Reichert]], a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]. According to DelBene's campaign website, the economy was her top priority.<ref>[http://delbeneforcongress.com/content/id/4/Why-I%27m-Running Why I'm Running] DelBene for Congress</ref> DelBene earned the endorsements of the [[Seattle Times]] and the [[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]],<ref>{{Cite web | title = The Times endorses Suzan DelBene in the 8th Congressional District | publisher = Seattle Times | date = October 12, 2010 | url= http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/editorials/2013142434_edit13district08.html | accessdate = October 15, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | title = Send DelBene to Congress | publisher = Seattle Post-Intelligencer | date = October 13, 2010 | url= http://www.seattlepi.com/opinion/428293_PICong8.html | accessdate = October 15, 2010}}</ref> as well as several Democratic politicians.<ref>[http://www.pnwlocalnews.com/east_king/bel/news/52389537.html Ross Hunter endorses Suzan DelBene for Congress] ''Bellevue Reporter'' Aug 3, 2009</ref>

DelBene faced Reichert in the general election, after coming in 2nd in the primary voting. In Washington, the top two advance. DelBene lost to Reichert in the general election on November 2. She was subsequently named Washington State Revenue Director by Governor [[Christine Gregoire]] on November 30, 2010.

;2012
DelBene ran for Congress again in 2012. DelBene won the Democratic nomination for the newly drawn 1st District, previously represented by [[Jay Inslee]], which became more competitive due to redistricting.  Inslee had resigned in March to focus on his ultimately successful campaign for governor.<ref name=seattletimes>{{cite news|last=Martin|first=Jonathan|title=The race is on to fill new 1st Congressional District|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2018198362_1stdistrict13m.html|accessdate=May 31, 2012|newspaper=Seattle Times|date=May 12, 2012}}</ref>  DelBene ran in two elections that day against Republican John Koster—a special election for the last two months of Inslee's seventh term (and held in the boundaries of the old 1st), and a regular election for a full two-year term.  She defeated Koster in both elections, winning the special election with 60 percent of the vote and the regular election with 54 percent of the vote.  Her victory margin in the regular election was wider than expected, considering that the district was about six points less Democratic than its predecessor.<ref name="seattletimescall"/><ref name="Timesunion"/> On November 13, 2012, she was sworn in as the district's Representative in the remainder of the [[112th United States Congress|112th Congress]], giving her a leg up in seniority over all but a few other congressmen first elected in 2012.<ref>[http://clerk.house.gov/floorsummary/floor.aspx?day=20121113 House Floor Activities/Legislative Day of November 13, 2012], [[United States House of Representatives]]</ref>

Del Bene spent $2.8 million of her own money in a race in which she raised over $4 million, according to <ref>[http://www.heraldnet.com/article/20121106/NEWS01/711069811 DelBene leading Koster for Congress in 1st Dist. | HeraldNet.com – Local news<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> in a Congressional race that became the most expensive in Washington state history.

;2014
DelBene ran for Congress again in 2014 and won against Republican [[Pedro Celis]].<ref>http://www.komonews.com/news/local/DelBene-wins-redrawn-1st-District-seat-Larson-wins-2nd-District-281568851.html</ref>  Delbene earned 55% of the vote to hold on to her seat.<ref>http://results.vote.wa.gov/results/20141104/CongressionalDistrict1.html</ref>

==Policy positions==
As of November 21, 2012, DelBene has a minimal legislative voting record. The following is based on her public statements, her spot in DCCC’s Competitive Red-Blue Program, and Sierra Club’s endorsement of her. She has also published issue positions on her campaign website<ref>[http://www.delbeneforcongress.com/index.php/issues DelBene for Congress: Issues]</ref> and House of Representatives website.<ref>[http://delbene.house.gov/issues Congresswoman DelBene: Issues]</ref>

DelBene believes that the top priority within her district is job creation and strengthening the economy.  She states “In Congress, I will work for policies that increase research and development investments in new, emerging industries. Instead of tax breaks for companies that ship their jobs overseas, I will fight for incentives that encourage businesses to expand their domestic manufacturing footprint.”<ref name="edmonds.patch.com">[http://edmonds.patch.com/articles/meet-suzan-delbene-candidate-for-us-house-of-representatives-district-1-4cdb49cb Meet Suzan DelBene: Candidate for U.S. House of Representatives, District 1 – Government – Edmonds, WA Patch<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> With regard to [[Washington Referendum 74]], DelBene proclaimed her belief that gay marriage should be legal in Washington, and the federal Defense of Marriage Act should be repealed, because everyone has equal rights under the law.<ref name="edmonds.patch.com"/> When asked about [[Washington Initiative 502]], DelBene responded that she “support[s] efforts to reclassify Marijuana for medicinal use,” and that she planned on voting YES for I-502.<ref name="edmonds.patch.com"/>  Additionally, DelBene gave a statement on the Supreme Court’s decision to uphold the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|Affordable Care Act]].  She espouses that “The Affordable Care Act upheld today is already helping millions in Washington state by allowing children to be covered on their parent’s plans until age 26, preventing insurance companies from denying coverage because of pre-existing conditions and reducing costs of prescription drugs for seniors on Medicare”<ref>[http://votesmart.org/public-statement/733988/suzan-delbenes-statement-on-supreme-courts-decision-to#.UKv95uSunIw Suzan DelBene's Statement on Supreme Court's Decision to Uphold the Affordable Care Act – Public Statements – Project Vote Smart<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Delbene’s earning of a spot on the [[Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee]] (DCCC)’s “Red-to-Blue” program on August 8, 2012, is due to the fact that, as Chairman [[Steve Israel]] stated, “There is strong grassroots energy behind Suzan DelBene’s campaign because she knows how to create jobs.  Her successful career in both the public and private sector gives her the tools and background to be a thoughtful leader who can stand up to a dysfunctional Congress and bring results for Washington’s middle class.”<ref>[http://votesmart.org/public-statement/733985/suzan-delbene-earns-a-spot-in-dcccs-competitive#.UKv9xOSunIw Suzan DelBene Earns a Spot in DCCC's Competitive Red-to-Blue Program – Public Statements – Project Vote Smart<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The [[Sierra Club]], one of the largest grassroots environmental organizations in the U.S., endorsed DelBene on July 20, 2012.  This endorsement reflects DelBene’s policy position on environmental and economic issues.  She articulates that she “will work tirelessly to ensure our nation takes meaningful steps to build a new economy based on clean and renewable energy sources and reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and foreign oil.” DelBene relays that the 1st Congressional district will fight to promote research and innovation in the field of [[renewable energy]].  She furthermore finds it critical that Washington protect its waterways and wild lands.<ref>[http://votesmart.org/public-statement/733987/sierra-club-endorses-suzan-delbene#.UKv92OSunIw Sierra Club Endorses Suzan DelBene – Public Statements – Project Vote Smart<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In addition to the Sierra Club’s endorsement, many other organizations supported DelBene, including [[Washington State Labor Council]], [[National Education Association]], [[American Federation of Teachers|AFT]] Washington, [[SEIU]], [[Sheet Metal Workers' International Association|Sheet Metal Workers]], Operating Engineers, [[Communications Workers of America]] and [[International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers|Aerospace Machinists]] District 751.

==Personal life==
Her husband, [[Kurt DelBene]], EVP of Corporate Strategy and Planning at Microsoft, is a venture partner at [[Madrona Venture Group]], a Seattle-based venture capital firm.<ref name=Madrona>{{cite web|title=Kurt Delbene|url=http://www.madrona.com/venture-capital-team/team-members.asp?name=Kurt-Delbene&member=35|website=Madrona|accessdate=5 November 2014}}</ref>
