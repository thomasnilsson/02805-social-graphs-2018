Michaud ran for Congress in [[United States House of Representatives elections, 2002#Maine|2002]] for [[Maine's 2nd congressional district]] after incumbent Democrat [[John Baldacci]] decided to run for [[Governor of Maine]].

Longley, by 4 percentage points. The general election garnered considerable publicity because Michaud was [[pro-life]], while the Republican was [[pro-choice]].
