'''Leon Acton''' "'''Lynn'''" '''Westmoreland''' (born April 2, 1950) is the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|Georgia|3|}}, serving since 2005. The district, numbered as the {{ushr|Georgia|8}} during his first term, stretches from the far southern [[Atlanta]] suburbs to the suburbs of [[Columbus, Georgia|Columbus]]. He is a member of the [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]].

==Early life, education and career==
Westmoreland was born in Atlanta, the son of Margaret Ferrell (née Lawson) and Leon Acton Westmoreland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~battle/reps/westmoreland.htm |title=Lynn Westmoreland |publisher=Freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com |date= |accessdate=2015-04-01}}</ref> He grew up in Metro Atlanta. He has no degree beyond a high school diploma. He attended [[Georgia State University]],but dropped out to work in a family construction business in which he later became an executive. He served in the [[Georgia House of Representatives]] from 1993 to 2005, rising to the position of House Republican Leader in 2001. He held that position until 2003 when he stepped down in order to devote time to his Congressional campaign in late 2003. He continued to serve in the Georgia House until his election to the US House in 2005.

As Republican Leader in the Georgia House, he led the fight against intense partisan [[gerrymandering]] during the redistricting process controlled by the Democratic majority in 2001. He abandoned his opposition and was instrumental in the mid-decade redistricting that took place in 2005, after Republicans won control of the Georgia legislature in the 2004 elections.<ref name=WashTimes>{{cite news |url=http://images.washtimes.com/national/20050225-111610-4014r.htm |title=Election districts drawing attention |publisher=The Washington Times |date=February 26, 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061101011854/http://images.washtimes.com/national/20050225-111610-4014r.htm |archivedate=November 1, 2006}}</ref><ref name="NYT">[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/20/us/20murphy.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120107042244/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/20/us/20murphy.html |date=January 7, 2012 }}</ref><ref>[http://times-georgian.com/view/full_story/3278580/article-Georgia--Carroll--Haralson-remember-Tom-Murphy ]{{dead link|date=April 2015}}</ref>

===Tenure===
During his first term in the [[109th United States Congress]], Westmoreland was appointed to the [[U.S. House Committee on Small Business]], [[U.S. House Committee on Government Reform]], and the [[U.S. House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}. In January 2015, the House Intelligence Committee was reorganized, and a subcommittee on Cybersecurity and the National Security Agency was created with Westmoreland appointed to be the subcommittee's first chairman.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://thehill.com/policy/technology/231044-spy-panel-shakeup-will-add-focus-on-cyber-cia | title=Spy panel shakeup will add focus on cyber, CIA | accessdate=2014-01-30 | last=Hattem| first=Julian  | date=2014-01-28 | work=The Hill}}</ref>

As a U.S. congressman, Westmoreland cosponsored a bill to place the [[Ten Commandments]] in the House of Representatives and the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. Westmoreland also sponsored a bill that the Ten Commandments could be displayed in courthouses in a historical setting.<ref name=11alive>{{cite news|url=http://www.11alive.com/news/news_article.aspx?storyid=43064|title=GOP Intros 10 Commandments Bill|agency=Associated Press}}{{dead link|date=December 2012}}</ref> In May 2006, political humorist [[Stephen Colbert]] interviewed Westmoreland for ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' show segment ''[[Better Know a District]]'', and during the interview, asked Westmoreland to name the Ten Commandments.

Westmoreland led a group of congressmen who opposed the 2006 renewal of certain provisions in the [[Voting Rights Act]] that require nine Southern states and a number of counties (mostly in the South) to obtain Federal permission for certain changes to election law or changes in venue.  Westmoreland and his colleagues claimed that it was no longer fair to target their states, given the passage of time since 1965 and the changes their states had made to provide fair elections and voting.  Despite Westmoreland's objections, a strong bipartisan majority renewed the Voting Rights Act for another 25 years without changes.<ref name="cbsnews">{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/07/14/ap/politics/mainD8IRNHO85.shtml|title=House Renews Voting Rights Act Unchanged|publisher=''CBS News''|accessdate=2008-08-29|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080427042841/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/07/14/ap/politics/mainD8IRNHO85.shtml|archivedate=2008-04-27}}</ref>

==Controversy==
On September 4, 2008, Westmoreland described [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] presidential nominee [[Barack Obama]] and his wife [[Michelle Obama|Michelle]] as "[[wikt:uppity|uppity]]", a pejorative considered by some as historically used to describe African-Americans who have made economic, social, or political progress.<ref name="LATimes">{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-shipler16apr16,0,2335261.story |title=Racism's resonance |publisher=Latimes.com |date=1994-11-08 |accessdate=2015-04-01 |first=David K. |last=Shipler}}</ref> Westmoreland said to reporters, "Just from what little I’ve seen of her and Mr. Obama, Senator Obama, they're a member of an elitist-class individual that thinks that they're uppity." When asked to confirm his use of the word,  Westmoreland answered, "Uppity, yeah."<ref name="HILL">{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/leading-the-news/westmoreland-calls-obama-uppity-2008-09-04.html |title=News Archive |publisher=TheHill.com |date= |accessdate=2015-04-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cqpolitics.com/cq-assets/cqmultimedia/audio/uppity.mp3|format=MP3|title=Audio recording of Rep. Westmoreland referring to Obamas as "uppity"|publisher=Cqpolitics.com|accessdate=2015-04-01}}</ref>

The ensuing media attention compelled Westmoreland to issue the following statement: "I’ve never heard that term used in a racially derogatory sense. It is important to note that the dictionary definition of 'uppity' is 'affecting an air of inflated self-esteem—snobbish.' That's what we meant by uppity when we used it in the mill village where I grew up."<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2008/09/rep-westmorelan.html|work=The Los Angeles Times|title=Top of the Ticket|date=September 5, 2008}}</ref>

During the national debate in 2015 over the future of the Confederate flag some Republicans proposed a moderate amendment to allow Confederate symbols at national cemeteries. Representative Lynn Westmoreland distinguished between racism and a memorial,<ref name="NYT_2015">{{citation |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/10/us/republicans-back-down-on-confederate-flags-at-us-cemeteries.html?partner=socialflow&smid=tw-nytimes |publisher=New York Times |date=10 July 2015 |accessdate=10 July 2015 |title=Republicans Retreat as Confederate Flag Issue Roils Congress |authors= JENNIFER STEINHAUER and JONATHAN WEISMAN |location=Washington, DC}}</ref>

{{quote|"When you’re putting a flag on someone’s grave, to me it’s a little different from being racist. It’s more of a memorial... You can’t make an excuse for things that happened, but the majority of people that actually died in the Civil War on the Confederate side did not own slaves. These were people that were fighting for their states. I don’t think they had even any thoughts about slavery."|Representative Lynn Westmoreland July 2015}}
When Westmoreland was asked if he understood Representative [[John Lewis (Georgia politician)|John Lewis]] perspective, he responded,"I guess the question is, ‘Does he understand where I’m coming from?"<ref name="NYT_2015" />

==Political campaigns==
Westmoreland won a plurality of votes in the Republican primary election in 2004, but faced fellow Republican Dylan Glenn in a runoff. Westmoreland received 55.5% of the vote in the runoff. The district was so heavily Republican that Westmoreland's primary victory was [[tantamount to election]] in November. He routed his [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] opponent, businesswoman Silvia Delamar, with almost 76% of the vote. The district was renumbered as the 3rd in 2006 and made even more Republican than its predecessor. Westmoreland was reelected five more times from this district with no substantive opposition.

==Personal life==
He resides in [[Grantville, Georgia]], with his wife, Joan; they have three children and seven grandchildren.
