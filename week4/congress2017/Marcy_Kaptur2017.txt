Kaptur graduated from [[St. Ursula Academy (Toledo, Ohio)|St. Ursula Academy]] in 1964 and became the first member in her family to attend college. She received her undergraduate degree from the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] in 1968 and a [[Master of Urban Planning]] from the [[Taubman College of Architecture and Urban Planning|University of Michigan]] in 1974.<ref>{{cite web|author=[[Taubman College of Architecture and Urban Planning]] |url=http://taubmancollege.umich.edu/news_and_events/events/archives/2009-2010/?event=000000000000000000000000000000000000000003227876 |title=Lecture: Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur, An Urban Planner in Congress|accessdate=2011-10-10}}</ref> She did post-graduate study in urban planning at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in 1981.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Schenken|first1=Suzanne O'Dea|title=From Suffrage to the Senate: An Encyclopedia of American Women in Politics|date=1999|publisher=ABC-Clio|location=Santa Barbara, California|isbn=0-87436-960-6|page=370|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Si6ZVqdOqIgC&lpg=PA370&dq=%22marcy%20kaptur%22&pg=PA370#v=onepage&q&f=false|chapter=Kaptur, Marcia (Marcy) Carolyn (b. 1946)}}</ref>

Kaptur served on the Toledo-[[Lucas County, Ohio|Lucas County]] Plan Commissions from 1969 to 1975.

While pursuing a doctorate in urban planning development finance at MIT, Kaptur was recruited to run for Congress in 1982 against freshman [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Ed Weber]], who had upset 26-year incumbent [[Lud Ashley]] two years earlier.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Former Congressman Weber backs Ferner for mayor|url = http://www.toledoblade.com/local/2015/10/27/Former-Congressman-Weber-backs-Ferner-for-mayor.html|website = Toledo Blade|access-date = 2016-01-28}}</ref> Despite being outspent by almost 3-1, she defeated Weber 58%-39% in what was and still is considered an upset.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=37212 |title=OH District 9 Race |publisher=Our Campaigns |date=November 2, 1982 |accessdate=2012-08-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kaptur.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=98&Itemid=26 |title=Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur: Biography |publisher=Kaptur.house.gov |accessdate=2012-08-30}}</ref>

In 1984, Kaptur faced a strong challenge from Republican Frank Venner, longtime anchorman and weatherman at [[WTVG]], but defeated him 55%-44%,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=52145 |title=OH District 9 Race |publisher=Our Campaigns |date=November 6, 1984 |accessdate=2012-08-30}}</ref> even as [[Ronald Reagan]] carried the district. The district reverted to form, and from 1986 to 2002, she won every election with at least 74% of the vote. In 2004, she faced her strongest challenger in 20 years in Lucas County auditor [[Larry A. Kaczala|Larry Kaczala]]. However, Kaptur dispatched him fairly easily, winning by 68%-32%.

Shortly after achieving fame during the 2008 election, conservative figure [[Joe the Plumber|Samuel "Joe the Plumber" Wurzelbacher]] announced that he was considering challenging Kaptur in the 2010 election.<ref name="ANI">{{cite web

However, he chose not to run. Kaptur was instead challenged by Republican [[Rich Iott]], a [[Tea Party movement]] favorite. Kaptur won re-election to her 15th term with 59% of the vote,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/politics/election-results-2010/#/house/ |title=2010 Election: Live Results |work=The Washington Post |accessdate=2010-11-08}}</ref> which was her closest election since 1984.

;2012
For her first three decades in Congress, Kaptur represented a compact district centered around Toledo.  Redistricting after the 2010 census extended the 9th District all the way to western [[Cleveland]].  The new map put the home of incumbent 10th District congressman [[Dennis Kucinich]] into the 9th as well, so they ran against each other in the Democratic primary. Graham Veysey, a small-business owner from Cleveland, also ran in the primary. Kaptur won the primary with 56% of the vote, while Kucinich received 40%.<ref>http://www.politico.com/2012-election/map/#/House/2012/Primary/OH</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=745617 |title=OH District 9 - D Primary Race |publisher=Our Campaigns |date=March 6, 2012 |accessdate=2012-08-30}}</ref> In the general election, she won a 16th term against Republican [[Joe the Plumber|Samuel "Joe the Plumber" Wurzelbacher]] and [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian]] Sean Stipe.<ref name="marcy kaptur coasts">{{cite news |title=Marcy Kaptur coasts to win in 9th District congressional race |url=http://www.cleveland.com/sun/all/index.ssf/2012/11/marcie_kaptur_coasts_to_win_in.html |publisher=Sun News |first=Joe |last=Noga |date=November 7, 2012}}</ref>  However, the reconfigured 9th was no less Democratic than its predecessor, and Kaptur had effectively clinched reelection by defeating Kucinich in the primary.

;2014
Kaptur's 2014 opponent was Richard May, a longtime Republican activist from west Cleveland, who beat Lakewood resident Robert C. Horrocks, Jr. in the May 6 primary.<ref>http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2014/05/richard_may_of_cleveland_wins.html</ref> Kaptur won 68%-32%.

===Tenure===
Kaptur is a member of the [[Congressional Progressive Caucus]]. She was once named "Most Valuable Member" of the House by ''[[The Nation]]''. In 1996, Kaptur was asked by [[Ross Perot]] to be his vice-presidential running mate. She eventually declined.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/103411/page/4 |title=Ross Reruns |work=Newsweek |date=November 18, 1996 |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref>

====Patent reform====
Kaptur was a dedicated opponent of the [[America Invents Act]] that passed into law and changed the U.S. Patent System. Kaptur opposed changing from a "first to invent system" to a "first to file system," claiming it hurt small businesses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/special-reports/patent-reform-june-2009 |title=Patent Reform |publisher=The Hill |date=June 2009 |accessdate=2012-08-30}}</ref> Kaptur stated "Our patent system is the finest in the world... the proposed solutions are special fixes that benefit these few giants at the expense of everyone else."<ref>{{cite web|last=Kaptur |first=Marcy |url=http://thehill.com/special-reports/patent-reform-june-2009/47125-tech-giants-are-aiming-to-infringe |title=Tech giants are aiming to infringe |publisher=The Hill |date=June 22, 2009 |accessdate=2012-08-30}}</ref>

====World War II Memorial====
Responding to Roger Durbin, a [[World War II]] veteran and constituent, Kaptur first suggested the creation of a [[National World War II Memorial]] in [[Washington, D.C]].{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

[[Image:WWII Memorial Atlantic.jpg|thumb|The World War II National Memorial in Washington, D.C]]

On December 10, 1987, Kaptur introduced the World War II Memorial Act to the House of Representatives.  The legislation authorized the [[American Battle Monuments Commission]] to establish a World War II memorial, however, as the bill was not voted on before the end of the session it failed to be enacted into law. Kaptur introduced similar legislation in 1989 and 1991 but these bills also failed to become law.

Kaptur introduced legislation for the fourth time on January 27, 1993.  This time the legislation was voted on and passed in the House on May 10, 1993. After a companion bill was passed in the [[United States Senate]], President [[Bill Clinton]] signed the bill into law on May 25, 1993. Durbin died before the memorial was built, but Kaptur spoke at the memorial dedication ceremony, along with Durbin's granddaughter, on May 29, 2004.

Kaptur later said that she felt "a great sense of fulfillment" that the memorial was finally built.  "This generation was the most unselfish America has ever seen," she said. "They never asked anybody for anything in return."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D02E7DD1F3EF933A05756C0A9629C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=print | work=The New York Times | first=Michael | last=Janofsky | accessdate=May 12, 2010 | title=Veterans Gather to Dedicate World War II Memorial | date=May 30, 2004}}</ref>

On April 12, 2011, Kaptur introduced H.R. 1489 to restore the [[Glass-Steagall Act]]. It states "To repeal certain provisions of the [[Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act]] and revive the separation between commercial banking and the securities business, in the manner provided in the Banking Act of 1933, the so-called "Glass-Steagall Act", and for other purposes." There were 30 co-sponsors.

====Abortion====
Kaptur holds a 95% approval rating from NARAL.  She has stated that she supports Roe v. Wade, calling it "the law of the land" (Washington Journal, 9/17/2015).  She has voted in favor of some proposals to restrict access to abortion, while opposing some others. In January 2007, she was the only member of the [[Congressional Progressive Caucus]] to vote against federally funded embryonic stem-cell research.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2007/roll020.xml |title=Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act |publisher=House.gov |date=January 11, 2007 |accessdate=2012-08-30}}</ref> Kaptur expressed support for the [[Stupak-Pitts Amendment]], an amendment to America's Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009, and voted in favor of it on November 9.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2009/roll884.xml |title=Stupak of Michigan Amendment |publisher=House.gov |date=November 7, 2009 |accessdate=2012-08-30}}</ref> Kaptur was one of only sixteen Democrats to vote in favor of the [[No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act]] on May 4, 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2011/roll292.xml |title=No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act |publisher=House.gov |date=May 4, 2011 |accessdate=2012-08-30}}</ref> Kaptur also voted in favor of banning partial-birth abortions in 2000 and 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2000/roll104.xml |title=Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2000 |publisher=House.gov |date=April 5, 2000 |accessdate=2012-08-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2003/roll530.xml |title=On Agreeing to the Conference Report |publisher=House.gov |date=October 2, 2003 |accessdate=2012-08-30}}</ref> Kaptur voted against the [[Child Custody Protection Act]] in 1999 and the [[Child Interstate Abortion Notification Act]] in 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/evs/1999/roll261.xml |title=Child Custody Protection Act |publisher=House.gov |date=June 30, 1999 |accessdate=2012-08-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2005/roll144.xml |title=Child Interstate Abortion Notification Act |publisher=House.gov |date=April 27, 2005 |accessdate=2012-08-30}}</ref> Kaptur voted against allowing privately funded abortions at overseas military hospitals twice in 1995, as well as 1997, 1998 and 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/evs/1995/roll382.xml |title=DeLauro of Connecticut Amendment |publisher=House.gov |date=June 15, 1995 |accessdate=2012-08-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/evs/1995/roll642.xml |title=Dornan of California |publisher=House.gov |date=September 7, 1995 |accessdate=2012-08-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/evs/1997/roll217.xml |title=Harman of California Amendment |publisher=House.gov |date=June 19, 1997 |accessdate=2012-08-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/evs/1998/roll171.xml |title=Lowey of New York Amendment |publisher=House.gov |date=May 20, 1998 |accessdate=2012-08-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/evs/1999/roll184.xml |title=Meek of Florida Amendment |publisher=House.gov |date=June 9, 1999 |accessdate=2012-08-30}}</ref> In 2005, Kaptur voted in favor of lifting the ban on abortions at overseas military hospitals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2005/roll216.xml |title=Davis of California Amendment |publisher=House.gov |date=May 25, 2005 |accessdate=2012-08-30}}</ref>

====Free trade====
Kaptur is a staunch opponent of [[free trade]] agreements. She helped lead opposition to the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]], [[permanent normal trade relations]] for the People's Republic of China, and fast track authority for the president.

====2008 economic crisis====
Marcy Kaptur expressed strong opposition to the [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008]], which provided a [[bailout]] for U.S. banks.<ref>[http://www.kaptur.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=289&Itemid=1 THE LATEST REALITY GAME--WALL STREET BAILOUT] House of Representatives - September 22, 2008.</ref> Addressing [[Wall Street]] banks, she said, "You have perpetrated the greatest financial crimes ever on this American Republic."

She also stated, "America doesn't need to bail you out. It needs to secure real assets and property. Federal regional reserve banks should have a new job to help renegotiate . American people should get equity in any companies. Major job creation to rebuild our infrastructure. Regulate, we need a modern [[Glass–Steagall Act]]. Refinancing must return a major share of profits to a new Social Security and Medicare lock box."

Kaptur's opposition to the [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008]] was highlighted in [[Michael Moore]]'s 2009 documentary ''[[Capitalism: A Love Story]]''<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1920771,00.html | work=Time | title=Michael Moore's Capitalism Goes for Broke | date=September 6, 2009}}</ref>

====The environment====
Marcy Kaptur backed The [[American Clean Energy and Security Act]] in the U.S. House after she was able to insert an amendment that would authorize the Secretary of Energy to create power marketing authorities in regions where none exist. One such area would be the Great Lakes region. Kaptur said the St. Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation could serve as the vehicle for administering up to $3.5 billion in borrowing authority to stimulate economic development through creation of green energy such as solar power and wind power. Kaptur said the $3.5 billion in borrowing authority would promote "regional equity" and serve as a powerful engine for job creation in a region that has suffered from high energy costs, especially expensive electricity.

==== Agriculture ====
Marcy Kaptur helped to protect the rights of chicken farmers to speak up about mistreatment and unfair practices. She helped to remove anti-Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration (anti-GIPSA) language.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://pingree.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/ag-spending-bill-contains-big-win-protect-rights-chicken-farmers-after|title = Ag spending bill contains big win to protect rights for chicken farmers after viral John Oliver video brought attention to their plight|website = Congresswoman Chellie Pingree|access-date = 2016-03-09}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last = LastWeekTonight|title = Last Week Tonight with John Oliver: Chickens (HBO)|date = 2015-05-17|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9wHzt6gBgI&feature=youtu.be|accessdate = 2016-03-09}}</ref>

While pursuing a doctorate in urban planning development finance at MIT, Kaptur was recruited to run for Congress in 1982 against freshman [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Ed Weber]], who had upset 26-year incumbent [[Lud Ashley]] two years earlier.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Former Congressman Weber backs Ferner for mayor|url = http://www.toledoblade.com/local/2015/10/27/Former-Congressman-Weber-backs-Ferner-for-mayor.html|website = Toledo Blade|access-date = 2016-01-28}}</ref> Despite being outspent by almost 3-1, she defeated Weber 58%-39% in what was and still is considered an upset.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=37212 |title=OH District 9 Race |publisher=Our Campaigns |date=November 2, 1982 |accessdate=2012-08-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kaptur.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=98&Itemid=26 |title=Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur: Biography |publisher=Kaptur.house.gov |accessdate=2012-08-30}}</ref>

In 1984, Kaptur faced a strong challenge from Republican Frank Venner, longtime anchorman and weatherman at [[WTVG]], but defeated him 55%-44%,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=52145 |title=OH District 9 Race |publisher=Our Campaigns |date=November 6, 1984 |accessdate=2012-08-30}}</ref> even as [[Ronald Reagan]] carried the district. The district reverted to form, and from 1986 to 2002, she won every election with at least 74% of the vote. In 2004, she faced her strongest challenger in 20 years in Lucas County auditor [[Larry A. Kaczala|Larry Kaczala]]. However, Kaptur dispatched him fairly easily, winning by 68%-32%.

Shortly after achieving fame during the 2008 election, conservative figure [[Joe the Plumber|Samuel "Joe the Plumber" Wurzelbacher]] announced that he was considering challenging Kaptur in the 2010 election.<ref name="ANI">{{cite web

However, he chose not to run. Kaptur was instead challenged by Republican [[Rich Iott]], a [[Tea Party movement]] favorite. Kaptur won re-election to her 15th term with 59% of the vote,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/politics/election-results-2010/#/house/ |title=2010 Election: Live Results |work=The Washington Post |accessdate=2010-11-08}}</ref> which was her closest election since 1984.

;2012
For her first three decades in Congress, Kaptur represented a compact district centered around Toledo.  Redistricting after the 2010 census extended the 9th District all the way to western [[Cleveland]].  The new map put the home of incumbent 10th District congressman [[Dennis Kucinich]] into the 9th as well, so they ran against each other in the Democratic primary. Graham Veysey, a small-business owner from Cleveland, also ran in the primary. Kaptur won the primary with 56% of the vote, while Kucinich received 40%.<ref>http://www.politico.com/2012-election/map/#/House/2012/Primary/OH</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=745617 |title=OH District 9 - D Primary Race |publisher=Our Campaigns |date=March 6, 2012 |accessdate=2012-08-30}}</ref> In the general election, she won a 16th term against Republican [[Joe the Plumber|Samuel "Joe the Plumber" Wurzelbacher]] and [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian]] Sean Stipe.<ref name="marcy kaptur coasts">{{cite news |title=Marcy Kaptur coasts to win in 9th District congressional race |url=http://www.cleveland.com/sun/all/index.ssf/2012/11/marcie_kaptur_coasts_to_win_in.html |publisher=Sun News |first=Joe |last=Noga |date=November 7, 2012}}</ref>  However, the reconfigured 9th was no less Democratic than its predecessor, and Kaptur had effectively clinched reelection by defeating Kucinich in the primary.

;2014
Kaptur's 2014 opponent was Richard May, a longtime Republican activist from west Cleveland, who beat Lakewood resident Robert C. Horrocks, Jr. in the May 6 primary.<ref>http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2014/05/richard_may_of_cleveland_wins.html</ref> Kaptur won 68%-32%.

===Tenure===
Kaptur is a member of the [[Congressional Progressive Caucus]]. She was once named "Most Valuable Member" of the House by ''[[The Nation]]''. In 1996, Kaptur was asked by [[Ross Perot]] to be his vice-presidential running mate. She eventually declined.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/103411/page/4 |title=Ross Reruns |work=Newsweek |date=November 18, 1996 |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref>

====Patent reform====
Kaptur was a dedicated opponent of the [[America Invents Act]] that passed into law and changed the U.S. Patent System. Kaptur opposed changing from a "first to invent system" to a "first to file system," claiming it hurt small businesses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/special-reports/patent-reform-june-2009 |title=Patent Reform |publisher=The Hill |date=June 2009 |accessdate=2012-08-30}}</ref> Kaptur stated "Our patent system is the finest in the world... the proposed solutions are special fixes that benefit these few giants at the expense of everyone else."<ref>{{cite web|last=Kaptur |first=Marcy |url=http://thehill.com/special-reports/patent-reform-june-2009/47125-tech-giants-are-aiming-to-infringe |title=Tech giants are aiming to infringe |publisher=The Hill |date=June 22, 2009 |accessdate=2012-08-30}}</ref>

Responding to Roger Durbin, a [[World War II]] veteran and constituent, Kaptur first suggested the creation of a [[National World War II Memorial]] in [[Washington, D.C]].{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

[[Image:WWII Memorial Atlantic.jpg|thumb|The World War II National Memorial in Washington, D.C]]

On December 10, 1987, Kaptur introduced the World War II Memorial Act to the House of Representatives.  The legislation authorized the [[American Battle Monuments Commission]] to establish a World War II memorial, however, as the bill was not voted on before the end of the session it failed to be enacted into law. Kaptur introduced similar legislation in 1989 and 1991 but these bills also failed to become law.

Kaptur introduced legislation for the fourth time on January 27, 1993.  This time the legislation was voted on and passed in the House on May 10, 1993. After a companion bill was passed in the [[United States Senate]], President [[Bill Clinton]] signed the bill into law on May 25, 1993. Durbin died before the memorial was built, but Kaptur spoke at the memorial dedication ceremony, along with Durbin's granddaughter, on May 29, 2004.

Kaptur later said that she felt "a great sense of fulfillment" that the memorial was finally built.  "This generation was the most unselfish America has ever seen," she said. "They never asked anybody for anything in return."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D02E7DD1F3EF933A05756C0A9629C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=print | work=The New York Times | first=Michael | last=Janofsky | accessdate=May 12, 2010 | title=Veterans Gather to Dedicate World War II Memorial | date=May 30, 2004}}</ref>

On April 12, 2011, Kaptur introduced H.R. 1489 to restore the [[Glass-Steagall Act]]. It states "To repeal certain provisions of the [[Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act]] and revive the separation between commercial banking and the securities business, in the manner provided in the Banking Act of 1933, the so-called "Glass-Steagall Act", and for other purposes." There were 30 co-sponsors.

====Abortion====
Kaptur holds a 95% approval rating from NARAL.  She has stated that she supports Roe v. Wade, calling it "the law of the land" (Washington Journal, 9/17/2015).  She has voted in favor of some proposals to restrict access to abortion, while opposing some others. In January 2007, she was the only member of the [[Congressional Progressive Caucus]] to vote against federally funded embryonic stem-cell research.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2007/roll020.xml |title=Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act |publisher=House.gov |date=January 11, 2007 |accessdate=2012-08-30}}</ref> Kaptur expressed support for the [[Stupak-Pitts Amendment]], an amendment to America's Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009, and voted in favor of it on November 9.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2009/roll884.xml |title=Stupak of Michigan Amendment |publisher=House.gov |date=November 7, 2009 |accessdate=2012-08-30}}</ref> Kaptur was one of only sixteen Democrats to vote in favor of the [[No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act]] on May 4, 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2011/roll292.xml |title=No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act |publisher=House.gov |date=May 4, 2011 |accessdate=2012-08-30}}</ref> Kaptur also voted in favor of banning partial-birth abortions in 2000 and 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2000/roll104.xml |title=Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2000 |publisher=House.gov |date=April 5, 2000 |accessdate=2012-08-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2003/roll530.xml |title=On Agreeing to the Conference Report |publisher=House.gov |date=October 2, 2003 |accessdate=2012-08-30}}</ref> Kaptur voted against the [[Child Custody Protection Act]] in 1999 and the [[Child Interstate Abortion Notification Act]] in 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/evs/1999/roll261.xml |title=Child Custody Protection Act |publisher=House.gov |date=June 30, 1999 |accessdate=2012-08-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2005/roll144.xml |title=Child Interstate Abortion Notification Act |publisher=House.gov |date=April 27, 2005 |accessdate=2012-08-30}}</ref> Kaptur voted against allowing privately funded abortions at overseas military hospitals twice in 1995, as well as 1997, 1998 and 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/evs/1995/roll382.xml |title=DeLauro of Connecticut Amendment |publisher=House.gov |date=June 15, 1995 |accessdate=2012-08-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/evs/1995/roll642.xml |title=Dornan of California |publisher=House.gov |date=September 7, 1995 |accessdate=2012-08-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/evs/1997/roll217.xml |title=Harman of California Amendment |publisher=House.gov |date=June 19, 1997 |accessdate=2012-08-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/evs/1998/roll171.xml |title=Lowey of New York Amendment |publisher=House.gov |date=May 20, 1998 |accessdate=2012-08-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/evs/1999/roll184.xml |title=Meek of Florida Amendment |publisher=House.gov |date=June 9, 1999 |accessdate=2012-08-30}}</ref> In 2005, Kaptur voted in favor of lifting the ban on abortions at overseas military hospitals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2005/roll216.xml |title=Davis of California Amendment |publisher=House.gov |date=May 25, 2005 |accessdate=2012-08-30}}</ref>

====Free trade====
Kaptur is a staunch opponent of [[free trade]] agreements. She helped lead opposition to the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]], [[permanent normal trade relations]] for the People's Republic of China, and fast track authority for the president.

====2008 economic crisis====
Marcy Kaptur expressed strong opposition to the [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008]], which provided a [[bailout]] for U.S. banks.<ref>[http://www.kaptur.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=289&Itemid=1 THE LATEST REALITY GAME--WALL STREET BAILOUT] House of Representatives - September 22, 2008.</ref> Addressing [[Wall Street]] banks, she said, "You have perpetrated the greatest financial crimes ever on this American Republic."

She also stated, "America doesn't need to bail you out. It needs to secure real assets and property. Federal regional reserve banks should have a new job to help renegotiate . American people should get equity in any companies. Major job creation to rebuild our infrastructure. Regulate, we need a modern [[Glass–Steagall Act]]. Refinancing must return a major share of profits to a new Social Security and Medicare lock box."

Kaptur's opposition to the [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008]] was highlighted in [[Michael Moore]]'s 2009 documentary ''[[Capitalism: A Love Story]]''<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1920771,00.html | work=Time | title=Michael Moore's Capitalism Goes for Broke | date=September 6, 2009}}</ref>

====The environment====
Marcy Kaptur backed The [[American Clean Energy and Security Act]] in the U.S. House after she was able to insert an amendment that would authorize the Secretary of Energy to create power marketing authorities in regions where none exist. One such area would be the Great Lakes region. Kaptur said the St. Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation could serve as the vehicle for administering up to $3.5 billion in borrowing authority to stimulate economic development through creation of green energy such as solar power and wind power. Kaptur said the $3.5 billion in borrowing authority would promote "regional equity" and serve as a powerful engine for job creation in a region that has suffered from high energy costs, especially expensive electricity.

==== Agriculture ====
Marcy Kaptur helped to protect the rights of chicken farmers to speak up about mistreatment and unfair practices. She helped to remove anti-Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration (anti-GIPSA) language.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://pingree.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/ag-spending-bill-contains-big-win-protect-rights-chicken-farmers-after|title = Ag spending bill contains big win to protect rights for chicken farmers after viral John Oliver video brought attention to their plight|website = Congresswoman Chellie Pingree|access-date = 2016-03-09}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last = LastWeekTonight|title = Last Week Tonight with John Oliver: Chickens (HBO)|date = 2015-05-17|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9wHzt6gBgI&feature=youtu.be|accessdate = 2016-03-09}}</ref>

====Other views====
She has consistently supported military spending bills.
