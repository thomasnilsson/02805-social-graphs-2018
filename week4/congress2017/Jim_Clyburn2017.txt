'''James Enos''' "'''Jim'''" '''Clyburn''' (born July 21, 1940) is the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|SC|6}}, serving since 1993, and the Assistant Democratic Leader since 2011.<ref>[http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2010/11/17/103928/a-new-era-for-sc-clyburn-scott.html A new era for SC: Clyburn, Scott get top House posts], James Rosen, ''[[McClatchy Newspapers]]'', November 17, 2010</ref> He was previously [[Party whips of the United States House of Representatives|House Majority Whip]], serving in that post from 2007 to 2011. He is a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. The district includes large portions of [[Columbia, South Carolina|Columbia]] and [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], as well as several rural areas between them. Clyburn is the current dean of the South Carolina congressional delegation.

As Assistant Democratic Leader, he is the third-ranking Democrat in the House behind [[Minority leader of the United States House of Representatives|House Minority Leader]] [[Nancy Pelosi]] and [[Party whips of the United States House of Representatives|Minority Whip]] [[Steny Hoyer]].

== Early life and education ==
Clyburn was born in [[Sumter, South Carolina]], the son of Enos Lloyd Clyburn, a [[fundamentalist]] [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]], and his wife, Almeta (née Dizzley), a beautician.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thestate.com/463/story/67142.html |title=Chapter 12 &#124; The parable of the talents – Crossing a Great Divide |publisher=TheState.com |date=May 17, 2007 |accessdate=August 29, 2010}}</ref> A distant relative of his was [[George W. Murray]], an organizer for the [[Colored Farmers' National Alliance and Cooperative Union|Colored Farmers Alliance]] (CFA), who was elected as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] South Carolina Congressman in the 53rd and 54th U.S. Congresses in the late nineteenth century. He and other black politicians had strongly opposed the 1895 state constitution, which essentially [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchised]] most African-American citizens, a situation that the state maintained for more than half a century until passage of federal civil rights legislation in the mid-1960s.

Clyburn graduated from Mather Academy (later named [[Boylan-Haven-Mather Academy]]) in [[Camden, South Carolina]], then attended South Carolina State College (now [[South Carolina State University]]), a [[historically black college]] in [[Orangeburg, South Carolina|Orangeburg]]. He was initiated into the [[Omega Psi Phi]] fraternity and graduated with a [[bachelor's degree]] in history.

For his first full-time position after college, Clyburn taught at C.A. Brown High School in [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]].

==Early political career==
After an unsuccessful run for the [[South Carolina General Assembly]], he moved to [[Columbia, South Carolina|Columbia]] to join the staff of [[Governor of South Carolina|Governor]] [[John C. West]] in 1971. He was appointed as the first minority advisor to a South Carolina governor. In the aftermath of the [[Orangeburg massacre]] of 1968, when protesting students at South Carolina State were killed by police,<ref>

</ref> West appointed Clyburn as the state's human affairs commissioner. He served in this position until 1992, when he stepped down to run for Congress.

== U.S. House of Representatives ==

===Elections===
Following the 1990 census South Carolina's district lines were redrawn. Due to prior racial discrimination before the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] required the 6th district, which had previously included the northeastern portion of the state, to be redrawn as a [[black-majority district]]. Before this ruling, African Americans were a minority in all six of South Carolina's districts.

;1992–2006
The reconfigured 6th stretched across most of South Carolina's [[Black Belt (U.S. region)|Black Belt]], but swept south to include most of the black precincts around Charleston and west to include most of the black precincts around Columbia, including Clyburn's home.  Five-term incumbent [[Robin Tallon]]'s home in [[Florence, South Carolina|Florence]] was in the district, but he chose to retire. Five candidates, all of whom were African American, ran for the Democratic Party nomination for the seat.  As this district was heavily Democratic, the primary was understood to be the real contest.

Clyburn secured 55% of the vote in the primary, eliminating the need for an expected run-off.  As expected, he won the general [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1992|election in November]] handily.  He has been reelected eight times with no substantive [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] opposition. From 1998 to 2006, his opponent was Gary McLeod, a conservative Republican from [[Clarendon County, South Carolina|Clarendon County]].

;2008
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in South Carolina, 2008#District6|United States House of Representatives elections in South Carolina, 2010#District6}}
Clyburn defeated the Republican candidate Nancy Harrelson by 68%-32%.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.enr-scvotes.org/SC/8562/13981/en/summary.html |title=South Carolina 2008 General Election Results |date=November 21, 2008 |accessdate=February 26, 2009 |postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>

;2010
Clyburn defeated the Republican candidate Jim Pratt, 65% to 34%.

;2014
Clyburn defeated the Republican candidate Anthony Culler, 73% to 25%.

===Tenure===
Jim Clyburn was elected as [[Democratic Caucus Vice-Chairman of the United States House of Representatives|vice-chairman of the House Democratic Caucus]] in 2003, the third-ranking post in the caucus.

He became the [[Democratic Caucus Chairman of the United States House of Representatives|chairman]] of the Democratic Caucus in the House in early 2006 after the caucus chairman [[Bob Menendez]] was appointed to the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. After the Democrats won control of the House of Representatives in the [[United States general elections, 2006|2006 election]], Clyburn was unanimously elected as Majority Whip in the [[110th United States Congress|110th Congress]].

Clyburn would have faced a challenge from [[Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee]] Chairman [[Rahm Emanuel]], but Speaker-elect [[Nancy Pelosi]] persuaded Emanuel to run for [[Democratic Caucus Chairman of the United States House of Representatives|Democratic Caucus Chairman]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/09/AR2006110901764.html | work=The Washington Post | first1=Charles | last1=Babington | first2=Jonathan | last2=Weisman | title=Reid, Pelosi Expected to Keep Tight Rein in Both Chambers | date=November 10, 2006}}</ref> Clyburn was interviewed by [[National Public Radio]]'s ''Morning Edition'' on January 12, 2007, and acknowledged the difficulty of counting votes and rallying the fractious Democratic caucus, while his party held the majority in the House.

After the [[United States general elections, 2010|2010 elections]], the Democrats lost their majority in the House. The departing Speaker Nancy Pelosi ran for the Minority Leader position in order to remain the House party leader, while Clyburn announced that he would challenge [[Steny Hoyer]], the second-ranking Democrat in the House and the outgoing Majority Leader, for the Minority Whip post. Clyburn had the support of the [[Congressional Black Caucus]], which wanted to keep an African-American in the House leadership, while Hoyer had 35 public endorsements, including three standing committee chairs. On November 13, Pelosi announced a deal whereby Hoyer would stand as Minority Whip, while a "number three" leadership position styled ''Assistant Leader'' would be created for Clyburn.<ref>{{cite news|url = http://edition.cnn.com/2010/POLITICS/11/13/democratic.leadership.battle/index.html?eref=edition|title = Deal ends Democratic leadership fight|author=[[Dana Bash]]|publisher=CNN|date = November 13, 2010 – Updated 2241 GMT (0641 HKT)}}</ref> The exact responsibilities of Clyburn's assistant leader office remain unclear, though it is said to replace the ''Assistant to the Leader'' post previously held by [[Chris Van Hollen]]. He had attended all leadership meetings but was not in the leadership hierarchy.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/politics/112congress/index.html | work=The Washington Post | first=David A. | last=Fahrenthold | title=Alexis Covey-Brandt}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/11/07/AR2010110704606.html | work=The Washington Post | first=Paul | last=Kane | title=House Democrats could retain leadership team | date=November 8, 2010}}</ref>

In August 2014, Clyburn warned that he expects President [[Barack Obama]] to be impeached should Republicans hold onto control of the House of Representatives in November 2014. [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] suggested that they do not plan to do so at this time and commentators considered the remark an effort to generate support for [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] in the midterms.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Fuller|first1=Matt|title=House Democrat: Look for Obama Impeachment if GOP Wins|url=http://blogs.rollcall.com/218/impeachmentobama-house-gop-clyburn/?dcz=emailalert|website=www.rollcall.com|publisher=Roll Call|accessdate=August 12, 2014}}</ref>

;Ideology
Clyburn is regarded as liberal in his political stances, actions and votes. A recent ranking by the ''[[National Journal]]'' ranked him as the 77th most liberal of all 435 US congressional representatives, and with a score of 81, indicating that the conductors of this study found his voting record to be more liberal than 81 percent of other members of the [[US House of Representatives]] based on their recent voting records.<ref>[http://www.nationaljournal.com/voteratings/house/lib.htm#results 2007 Vote Ratings] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910143851/http://www.nationaljournal.com/voteratings/house/lib.htm#results |date=September 10, 2015 }}</ref>

Clyburn has an established liberal stance on health care, education, [[organized labor]] and environmental conservation issues, based on his legislative actions as well as evaluations and ratings by pertinent interest groups.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://votesmart.org/issue_rating_category.php?can_id=27066 |title=Project Vote Smart: Clyburn |publisher=Votesmart.org |date=May 14, 2010 |accessdate=October 11, 2011}}</ref>

;Healthcare
In 2009, Clyburn introduced the Access for All Americans Act. The $26&nbsp;billion sought by this Act would provide funding to quadruple the number of community health centers in the US that provide medical care to uninsured and low-income citizens.<ref>[http://www.thestate.com/politics/story/698176.html Clyburn bill would extend healthcare] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430022204/http://www.thestate.com/politics/story/698176.html |date=April 30, 2009 }}</ref>

The [[American Public Health Association]], the [[American Academy of Family Physicians]], The Children’s Health Fund, and other health care interest groups rate Clyburn highly based on his voting record on pertinent issues. Other groups in this field, such as the [[American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]], give Clyburn ratings of zero.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://votesmart.org/issue_rating_category.php?can_id=27066&type=category&category=38&go.x=15&go.y=14 |title=Project Vote Smart: Clyburn: Health Issues |publisher=Votesmart.org |date= |accessdate=October 11, 2011}}</ref>

Despite his opposition to [[partial-birth abortion]], Clyburn is regarded to be [[pro-choice]] on the issue of abortion, as shown by his high ratings from [[Planned Parenthood]] and [[NARAL Pro-Choice America]], and low rating from the [[National Right to Life Committee]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://votesmart.org/issue_rating_category.php?can_id=27066&type=category&category=2&go.x=11&go.y=15 |title=Project Vote Smart: Clyburn: Abortion Issues |publisher=Votesmart.org |date= |accessdate=October 11, 2011}}</ref>

;Education
Clyburn has continuously sought new and additional funding for education. He has gained additional funding for special education<ref>[http://clyburn.house.gov/statements/cc011220education.html Education Advocates Give Funding a Boost December 20, 2001] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110203082648/http://clyburn.house.gov/statements/cc011220education.html |date=February 3, 2011 }}</ref> and lower interest rates on federal student loans.<ref>[http://majoritywhip.house.gov/daily_whipline/2008/04/17/ The Daily WhipLine April 17, 2008] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226053045/http://majoritywhip.house.gov/daily_whipline/2008/04/17/ |date=February 26, 2009 }}</ref> In many sessions has Clyburn sought, sponsored and/or voted for improvements in [[Pell Grant]] funding for college loans.<ref>[http://majoritywhip.house.gov/daily_whipline/2007/07/18/ ''The Daily WhipLine'', July 18, 2007] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226092321/http://majoritywhip.house.gov/daily_whipline/2007/07/18/ |date=February 26, 2009 }}</ref>

The [[National Education Association]] and the National Association of Elementary School Principals rate Clyburn very high, as do other education interest groups.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://votesmart.org/issue_rating_category.php?can_id=27066&type=category&category=27&go.x=18&go.y=12 |title=Project Vote Smart: Clyburn: Education |publisher=Votesmart.org |date= |accessdate=October 11, 2011}}</ref>

;Ports
Although he was criticized for a previous expenditure of 160 million dollars to expand South Carolina's ports, he stated he would continue to make funding available for further expansions.  The plan is to deepen the ports to allow for larger commercial ships to arrive from the Panama Canal which is currently being expanded to allow for larger ships to pass through. This is due primarily because of larger commercial ships coming from China, and also China's extremely high demand of soy beans, which are produced in South Carolina, but must be sent to larger ports for exporting.  This measure will benefit South Carolina business and farmers and is thus heavily backed by these groups.<ref>{{cite news |title= Clyburn says ports worth the investment|author= Gene Zaleski|url= http://thetandd.com/news/local/clyburn-says-ports-worth-the-investment/article_3cceeb36-e10e-11e1-817a-0019bb2963f4.html?comment_form=true|newspaper= The Times and Democrat|date= August 8, 2012|accessdate=August 16, 2012}}</ref>

;Labor
Clyburn has consistently voted for increases in [[minimum wage]] income and to restrict employer interference with labor union organization.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/House/James_Clyburn_Jobs.htm |title=Jim Clyburn on Jobs |publisher=Ontheissues.org |date= |accessdate=October 11, 2011}}</ref>

Many national labor unions, including the [[AFL-CIO]], the [[United Auto Workers]], the Communication Workers Association, and the
[[International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, Iron Ship Builders, Blacksmiths, Forgers and Helpers|International Brotherhood of Boilermakers]], give Clyburn outstanding ratings based on his voting record on issues that pertain to labor and employment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://votesmart.org/issue_rating_category.php?can_id=27066&type=category&category=43&go.x=6&go.y=7 |title=Project Vote Smart: Clyburn: Labor |publisher=Votesmart.org |date= |accessdate=October 11, 2011}}</ref>

;Environment
Clyburn has opposed legislation to increase [[offshore drilling]] for [[Oil well|oil]] or natural gas. Instead, he has promoted use of [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]] as an alternative to [[fossil fuels]], cheaper than [[wind energy|wind]] and [[solar energy]].
<ref>[http://clyburn.house.gov/pressroom-statements-detail.cfm?id=18 America’s Energy Future July 11, 2008] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110505021508/http://clyburn.house.gov/pressroom-statements-detail.cfm?id=18 |date=May 5, 2011 }}</ref> Members of the nuclear power industry have expressed that there is a mutual respect between Clyburn and themselves.<ref name="Charities cash">{{cite news|last=Lipton|first=Eric|title=Congressional Charities Pulling In Corporate Cash|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/06/us/politics/06charity.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=July 27, 2012|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=September 5, 2010}}</ref>  Clyburn pushed for a 2010 contract to convert plutonium from old weapons into nuclear fuel.<ref name="Charities cash"/><ref name="DOE Facility">{{cite news|title=Shaw AREVA MOX Services Awarded Multi-Billion Dollar Construction Option for DOE Facility|url=http://www.areva.com/EN/news-6625/shaw-areva-mox-services-awarded-multibillion-dollar-construction-option-for-doe-facility.html|accessdate=July 27, 2012|newspaper=Areva}}</ref>

Clyburn has been viewed favorably by organizations such as the [[League of Conservation Voters]] and [[Defenders of Wildlife]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://votesmart.org/issue_rating_category.php?can_id=27066&type=category&category=30&go.x=13&go.y=13 |title=Project Vote Smart: Clyburn: Environmental Issues |publisher=Votesmart.org |date= |accessdate=October 11, 2011}}</ref> However, he did anger environmentalists when he proposed building a $150 million bridge across a swampy area of Lake Marion in Calhoun county.

;War in Iraq
On July 31, 2007, Clyburn said in a broadcast interview that it would be a "real big problem" for the Democratic Party if General [[David Petraeus]] issued a positive report in September, as it would split the Democratic caucus on whether to continue to fund the [[Iraq War]].  While this soundbite caused some controversy, the full quote was, in reference to 47 member [[Blue Dog Coalition|Blue Dog caucus]], "I think there would be enough support in that group to want to stay the course and if the [[U.S. Republican Party|Republicans]] were to stay united as they have been, then it would be a problem for us."<ref>{{cite news

;Bill Clinton comments
Clyburn negatively viewed [[Bill Clinton]]'s remarks regarding [[Barack Obama]] winning the South Carolina primary. Clinton had compared Obama's victory to Rev. [[Jesse Jackson]]'s win in the [[Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 1988|1988 primary election]].<ref name=NYT2008-4-24>[http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/04/24/black-congressman-denounces-b-clintons-remarks/ Black Leader in House Denounces Bill Clinton’s Remarks] [[New York Times]] April 24, 2008</ref>
"Black people are incensed all over this," said Clyburn. Clinton responded that the campaign "played the [[race card]] on me," denying any racial tone in the comment.<ref>[http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/04/22/bill-clinton-irritated-by-race-card-questions/ Bill Clinton Irritated by Race-Card Questions] [[New York Times]] April 24, 2008</ref>  Speaking with the ''[[New York Times]]'', Clyburn said such actions could lead to a longtime division between the former president and his once most reliable constituency.
"When he was going through his [[Clinton impeachment|impeachment problems]], it was the black community that bellied up to the bar," Clyburn said. "I think black folks feel strongly that this is a strange way for President Clinton to show his appreciation."<ref name=NYT2008-4-24/>

;Conservative group caused Walter Scott murder comments
Clyburn took time on MSNBC to blame conservatives for the shooting of a black man by a white police officer.  Clyburn attempts to name the American Legislative Exchange Council saying, "They have drawn up these legislations, pieces of legislation like stand your ground, that legislation gives a license for people to be vigilantes. They are the ones that are drawing up all of these, uh, so-called voter ID laws. They are the ones that have been drawing up these unfair redistricting plans.
These people are a cancer eating at the inners (sic) of our society. And it's time for our elected officials to start speaking out about this because the climate that's being created is not a good climate. And that's why you have these rogue police officers feeling they have license to do what they want to do and there will be no consequences paid for it. And I think that that's the mindset of this police officer."<ref>http://newsbusters.org/blogs/ken-shepherd/2015/04/08/hardball-gives-platform-rep-clyburn-blame-conservative-leaning-alec</ref>

Clyburn, a [[superdelegate]], remained uncommitted throughout most of the 2008 presidential primary elections. He eventually endorsed Obama on June 3 immediately before the [[South Dakota]] primary (the result of said primary would have otherwise secured his party's nomination).<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/06/03/election.superdelegates/index.html Steady Stream of superdelegates pushed Obama over top] [[CNN]] June 3, 2008.</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Wilgoren|first=Debbi|title=Clyburn Endorses Obama|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/44/2008/06/clyburn-endorses-obama.html|accessdate=May 31, 2013|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=June 3, 2008}}</ref>

'''James Enos''' "'''Jim'''" '''Clyburn''' (born July 21, 1940) is the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|SC|6}}, serving since 1993, and the Assistant Democratic Leader since 2011.<ref>[http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2010/11/17/103928/a-new-era-for-sc-clyburn-scott.html A new era for SC: Clyburn, Scott get top House posts], James Rosen, ''[[McClatchy Newspapers]]'', November 17, 2010</ref> He was previously [[Party whips of the United States House of Representatives|House Majority Whip]], serving in that post from 2007 to 2011. He is a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. The district includes large portions of [[Columbia, South Carolina|Columbia]] and [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], as well as several rural areas between them. Clyburn is the current dean of the South Carolina congressional delegation.

As Assistant Democratic Leader, he is the third-ranking Democrat in the House behind [[Minority leader of the United States House of Representatives|House Minority Leader]] [[Nancy Pelosi]] and [[Party whips of the United States House of Representatives|Minority Whip]] [[Steny Hoyer]].

== Early life and education ==
Clyburn was born in [[Sumter, South Carolina]], the son of Enos Lloyd Clyburn, a [[fundamentalist]] [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]], and his wife, Almeta (née Dizzley), a beautician.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thestate.com/463/story/67142.html |title=Chapter 12 &#124; The parable of the talents – Crossing a Great Divide |publisher=TheState.com |date=May 17, 2007 |accessdate=August 29, 2010}}</ref> A distant relative of his was [[George W. Murray]], an organizer for the [[Colored Farmers' National Alliance and Cooperative Union|Colored Farmers Alliance]] (CFA), who was elected as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] South Carolina Congressman in the 53rd and 54th U.S. Congresses in the late nineteenth century. He and other black politicians had strongly opposed the 1895 state constitution, which essentially [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchised]] most African-American citizens, a situation that the state maintained for more than half a century until passage of federal civil rights legislation in the mid-1960s.

Clyburn graduated from Mather Academy (later named [[Boylan-Haven-Mather Academy]]) in [[Camden, South Carolina]], then attended South Carolina State College (now [[South Carolina State University]]), a [[historically black college]] in [[Orangeburg, South Carolina|Orangeburg]]. He was initiated into the [[Omega Psi Phi]] fraternity and graduated with a [[bachelor's degree]] in history.

For his first full-time position after college, Clyburn taught at C.A. Brown High School in [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]].

==Early political career==
After an unsuccessful run for the [[South Carolina General Assembly]], he moved to [[Columbia, South Carolina|Columbia]] to join the staff of [[Governor of South Carolina|Governor]] [[John C. West]] in 1971. He was appointed as the first minority advisor to a South Carolina governor. In the aftermath of the [[Orangeburg massacre]] of 1968, when protesting students at South Carolina State were killed by police,<ref>

</ref> West appointed Clyburn as the state's human affairs commissioner. He served in this position until 1992, when he stepped down to run for Congress.

== U.S. House of Representatives ==

===Elections===
Following the 1990 census South Carolina's district lines were redrawn. Due to prior racial discrimination before the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] required the 6th district, which had previously included the northeastern portion of the state, to be redrawn as a [[black-majority district]]. Before this ruling, African Americans were a minority in all six of South Carolina's districts.

;1992–2006
The reconfigured 6th stretched across most of South Carolina's [[Black Belt (U.S. region)|Black Belt]], but swept south to include most of the black precincts around Charleston and west to include most of the black precincts around Columbia, including Clyburn's home.  Five-term incumbent [[Robin Tallon]]'s home in [[Florence, South Carolina|Florence]] was in the district, but he chose to retire. Five candidates, all of whom were African American, ran for the Democratic Party nomination for the seat.  As this district was heavily Democratic, the primary was understood to be the real contest.

Clyburn secured 55% of the vote in the primary, eliminating the need for an expected run-off.  As expected, he won the general [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1992|election in November]] handily.  He has been reelected eight times with no substantive [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] opposition. From 1998 to 2006, his opponent was Gary McLeod, a conservative Republican from [[Clarendon County, South Carolina|Clarendon County]].

;2008
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in South Carolina, 2008#District6|United States House of Representatives elections in South Carolina, 2010#District6}}
Clyburn defeated the Republican candidate Nancy Harrelson by 68%-32%.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.enr-scvotes.org/SC/8562/13981/en/summary.html |title=South Carolina 2008 General Election Results |date=November 21, 2008 |accessdate=February 26, 2009 |postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>

;2010
Clyburn defeated the Republican candidate Jim Pratt, 65% to 34%.

;2014
Clyburn defeated the Republican candidate Anthony Culler, 73% to 25%.

===Tenure===
Jim Clyburn was elected as [[Democratic Caucus Vice-Chairman of the United States House of Representatives|vice-chairman of the House Democratic Caucus]] in 2003, the third-ranking post in the caucus.

He became the [[Democratic Caucus Chairman of the United States House of Representatives|chairman]] of the Democratic Caucus in the House in early 2006 after the caucus chairman [[Bob Menendez]] was appointed to the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. After the Democrats won control of the House of Representatives in the [[United States general elections, 2006|2006 election]], Clyburn was unanimously elected as Majority Whip in the [[110th United States Congress|110th Congress]].

Clyburn would have faced a challenge from [[Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee]] Chairman [[Rahm Emanuel]], but Speaker-elect [[Nancy Pelosi]] persuaded Emanuel to run for [[Democratic Caucus Chairman of the United States House of Representatives|Democratic Caucus Chairman]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/09/AR2006110901764.html | work=The Washington Post | first1=Charles | last1=Babington | first2=Jonathan | last2=Weisman | title=Reid, Pelosi Expected to Keep Tight Rein in Both Chambers | date=November 10, 2006}}</ref> Clyburn was interviewed by [[National Public Radio]]'s ''Morning Edition'' on January 12, 2007, and acknowledged the difficulty of counting votes and rallying the fractious Democratic caucus, while his party held the majority in the House.

After the [[United States general elections, 2010|2010 elections]], the Democrats lost their majority in the House. The departing Speaker Nancy Pelosi ran for the Minority Leader position in order to remain the House party leader, while Clyburn announced that he would challenge [[Steny Hoyer]], the second-ranking Democrat in the House and the outgoing Majority Leader, for the Minority Whip post. Clyburn had the support of the [[Congressional Black Caucus]], which wanted to keep an African-American in the House leadership, while Hoyer had 35 public endorsements, including three standing committee chairs. On November 13, Pelosi announced a deal whereby Hoyer would stand as Minority Whip, while a "number three" leadership position styled ''Assistant Leader'' would be created for Clyburn.<ref>{{cite news|url = http://edition.cnn.com/2010/POLITICS/11/13/democratic.leadership.battle/index.html?eref=edition|title = Deal ends Democratic leadership fight|author=[[Dana Bash]]|publisher=CNN|date = November 13, 2010 – Updated 2241 GMT (0641 HKT)}}</ref> The exact responsibilities of Clyburn's assistant leader office remain unclear, though it is said to replace the ''Assistant to the Leader'' post previously held by [[Chris Van Hollen]]. He had attended all leadership meetings but was not in the leadership hierarchy.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/politics/112congress/index.html | work=The Washington Post | first=David A. | last=Fahrenthold | title=Alexis Covey-Brandt}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/11/07/AR2010110704606.html | work=The Washington Post | first=Paul | last=Kane | title=House Democrats could retain leadership team | date=November 8, 2010}}</ref>

In August 2014, Clyburn warned that he expects President [[Barack Obama]] to be impeached should Republicans hold onto control of the House of Representatives in November 2014. [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] suggested that they do not plan to do so at this time and commentators considered the remark an effort to generate support for [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] in the midterms.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Fuller|first1=Matt|title=House Democrat: Look for Obama Impeachment if GOP Wins|url=http://blogs.rollcall.com/218/impeachmentobama-house-gop-clyburn/?dcz=emailalert|website=www.rollcall.com|publisher=Roll Call|accessdate=August 12, 2014}}</ref>

;Ideology
Clyburn is regarded as liberal in his political stances, actions and votes. A recent ranking by the ''[[National Journal]]'' ranked him as the 77th most liberal of all 435 US congressional representatives, and with a score of 81, indicating that the conductors of this study found his voting record to be more liberal than 81 percent of other members of the [[US House of Representatives]] based on their recent voting records.<ref>[http://www.nationaljournal.com/voteratings/house/lib.htm#results 2007 Vote Ratings] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910143851/http://www.nationaljournal.com/voteratings/house/lib.htm#results |date=September 10, 2015 }}</ref>

Clyburn has an established liberal stance on health care, education, [[organized labor]] and environmental conservation issues, based on his legislative actions as well as evaluations and ratings by pertinent interest groups.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://votesmart.org/issue_rating_category.php?can_id=27066 |title=Project Vote Smart: Clyburn |publisher=Votesmart.org |date=May 14, 2010 |accessdate=October 11, 2011}}</ref>

;Healthcare
In 2009, Clyburn introduced the Access for All Americans Act. The $26&nbsp;billion sought by this Act would provide funding to quadruple the number of community health centers in the US that provide medical care to uninsured and low-income citizens.<ref>[http://www.thestate.com/politics/story/698176.html Clyburn bill would extend healthcare] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430022204/http://www.thestate.com/politics/story/698176.html |date=April 30, 2009 }}</ref>

The [[American Public Health Association]], the [[American Academy of Family Physicians]], The Children’s Health Fund, and other health care interest groups rate Clyburn highly based on his voting record on pertinent issues. Other groups in this field, such as the [[American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]], give Clyburn ratings of zero.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://votesmart.org/issue_rating_category.php?can_id=27066&type=category&category=38&go.x=15&go.y=14 |title=Project Vote Smart: Clyburn: Health Issues |publisher=Votesmart.org |date= |accessdate=October 11, 2011}}</ref>

Despite his opposition to [[partial-birth abortion]], Clyburn is regarded to be [[pro-choice]] on the issue of abortion, as shown by his high ratings from [[Planned Parenthood]] and [[NARAL Pro-Choice America]], and low rating from the [[National Right to Life Committee]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://votesmart.org/issue_rating_category.php?can_id=27066&type=category&category=2&go.x=11&go.y=15 |title=Project Vote Smart: Clyburn: Abortion Issues |publisher=Votesmart.org |date= |accessdate=October 11, 2011}}</ref>

;Education
Clyburn has continuously sought new and additional funding for education. He has gained additional funding for special education<ref>[http://clyburn.house.gov/statements/cc011220education.html Education Advocates Give Funding a Boost December 20, 2001] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110203082648/http://clyburn.house.gov/statements/cc011220education.html |date=February 3, 2011 }}</ref> and lower interest rates on federal student loans.<ref>[http://majoritywhip.house.gov/daily_whipline/2008/04/17/ The Daily WhipLine April 17, 2008] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226053045/http://majoritywhip.house.gov/daily_whipline/2008/04/17/ |date=February 26, 2009 }}</ref> In many sessions has Clyburn sought, sponsored and/or voted for improvements in [[Pell Grant]] funding for college loans.<ref>[http://majoritywhip.house.gov/daily_whipline/2007/07/18/ ''The Daily WhipLine'', July 18, 2007] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226092321/http://majoritywhip.house.gov/daily_whipline/2007/07/18/ |date=February 26, 2009 }}</ref>

The [[National Education Association]] and the National Association of Elementary School Principals rate Clyburn very high, as do other education interest groups.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://votesmart.org/issue_rating_category.php?can_id=27066&type=category&category=27&go.x=18&go.y=12 |title=Project Vote Smart: Clyburn: Education |publisher=Votesmart.org |date= |accessdate=October 11, 2011}}</ref>

;Ports
Although he was criticized for a previous expenditure of 160 million dollars to expand South Carolina's ports, he stated he would continue to make funding available for further expansions.  The plan is to deepen the ports to allow for larger commercial ships to arrive from the Panama Canal which is currently being expanded to allow for larger ships to pass through. This is due primarily because of larger commercial ships coming from China, and also China's extremely high demand of soy beans, which are produced in South Carolina, but must be sent to larger ports for exporting.  This measure will benefit South Carolina business and farmers and is thus heavily backed by these groups.<ref>{{cite news |title= Clyburn says ports worth the investment|author= Gene Zaleski|url= http://thetandd.com/news/local/clyburn-says-ports-worth-the-investment/article_3cceeb36-e10e-11e1-817a-0019bb2963f4.html?comment_form=true|newspaper= The Times and Democrat|date= August 8, 2012|accessdate=August 16, 2012}}</ref>

;Labor
Clyburn has consistently voted for increases in [[minimum wage]] income and to restrict employer interference with labor union organization.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/House/James_Clyburn_Jobs.htm |title=Jim Clyburn on Jobs |publisher=Ontheissues.org |date= |accessdate=October 11, 2011}}</ref>

Many national labor unions, including the [[AFL-CIO]], the [[United Auto Workers]], the Communication Workers Association, and the
[[International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, Iron Ship Builders, Blacksmiths, Forgers and Helpers|International Brotherhood of Boilermakers]], give Clyburn outstanding ratings based on his voting record on issues that pertain to labor and employment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://votesmart.org/issue_rating_category.php?can_id=27066&type=category&category=43&go.x=6&go.y=7 |title=Project Vote Smart: Clyburn: Labor |publisher=Votesmart.org |date= |accessdate=October 11, 2011}}</ref>

;Environment
Clyburn has opposed legislation to increase [[offshore drilling]] for [[Oil well|oil]] or natural gas. Instead, he has promoted use of [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]] as an alternative to [[fossil fuels]], cheaper than [[wind energy|wind]] and [[solar energy]].
<ref>[http://clyburn.house.gov/pressroom-statements-detail.cfm?id=18 America’s Energy Future July 11, 2008] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110505021508/http://clyburn.house.gov/pressroom-statements-detail.cfm?id=18 |date=May 5, 2011 }}</ref> Members of the nuclear power industry have expressed that there is a mutual respect between Clyburn and themselves.<ref name="Charities cash">{{cite news|last=Lipton|first=Eric|title=Congressional Charities Pulling In Corporate Cash|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/06/us/politics/06charity.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=July 27, 2012|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=September 5, 2010}}</ref>  Clyburn pushed for a 2010 contract to convert plutonium from old weapons into nuclear fuel.<ref name="Charities cash"/><ref name="DOE Facility">{{cite news|title=Shaw AREVA MOX Services Awarded Multi-Billion Dollar Construction Option for DOE Facility|url=http://www.areva.com/EN/news-6625/shaw-areva-mox-services-awarded-multibillion-dollar-construction-option-for-doe-facility.html|accessdate=July 27, 2012|newspaper=Areva}}</ref>

Clyburn has been viewed favorably by organizations such as the [[League of Conservation Voters]] and [[Defenders of Wildlife]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://votesmart.org/issue_rating_category.php?can_id=27066&type=category&category=30&go.x=13&go.y=13 |title=Project Vote Smart: Clyburn: Environmental Issues |publisher=Votesmart.org |date= |accessdate=October 11, 2011}}</ref> However, he did anger environmentalists when he proposed building a $150 million bridge across a swampy area of Lake Marion in Calhoun county.

;War in Iraq
On July 31, 2007, Clyburn said in a broadcast interview that it would be a "real big problem" for the Democratic Party if General [[David Petraeus]] issued a positive report in September, as it would split the Democratic caucus on whether to continue to fund the [[Iraq War]].  While this soundbite caused some controversy, the full quote was, in reference to 47 member [[Blue Dog Coalition|Blue Dog caucus]], "I think there would be enough support in that group to want to stay the course and if the [[U.S. Republican Party|Republicans]] were to stay united as they have been, then it would be a problem for us."<ref>{{cite news

;Bill Clinton comments
Clyburn negatively viewed [[Bill Clinton]]'s remarks regarding [[Barack Obama]] winning the South Carolina primary. Clinton had compared Obama's victory to Rev. [[Jesse Jackson]]'s win in the [[Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 1988|1988 primary election]].<ref name=NYT2008-4-24>[http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/04/24/black-congressman-denounces-b-clintons-remarks/ Black Leader in House Denounces Bill Clinton’s Remarks] [[New York Times]] April 24, 2008</ref>
"Black people are incensed all over this," said Clyburn. Clinton responded that the campaign "played the [[race card]] on me," denying any racial tone in the comment.<ref>[http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/04/22/bill-clinton-irritated-by-race-card-questions/ Bill Clinton Irritated by Race-Card Questions] [[New York Times]] April 24, 2008</ref>  Speaking with the ''[[New York Times]]'', Clyburn said such actions could lead to a longtime division between the former president and his once most reliable constituency.
"When he was going through his [[Clinton impeachment|impeachment problems]], it was the black community that bellied up to the bar," Clyburn said. "I think black folks feel strongly that this is a strange way for President Clinton to show his appreciation."<ref name=NYT2008-4-24/>

;Conservative group caused Walter Scott murder comments
Clyburn took time on MSNBC to blame conservatives for the shooting of a black man by a white police officer.  Clyburn attempts to name the American Legislative Exchange Council saying, "They have drawn up these legislations, pieces of legislation like stand your ground, that legislation gives a license for people to be vigilantes. They are the ones that are drawing up all of these, uh, so-called voter ID laws. They are the ones that have been drawing up these unfair redistricting plans.
These people are a cancer eating at the inners (sic) of our society. And it's time for our elected officials to start speaking out about this because the climate that's being created is not a good climate. And that's why you have these rogue police officers feeling they have license to do what they want to do and there will be no consequences paid for it. And I think that that's the mindset of this police officer."<ref>http://newsbusters.org/blogs/ken-shepherd/2015/04/08/hardball-gives-platform-rep-clyburn-blame-conservative-leaning-alec</ref>
