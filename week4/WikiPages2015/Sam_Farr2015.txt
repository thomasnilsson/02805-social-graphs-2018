==State and local political career==
Farr’s public service career began in the [[California Assembly]], where he worked as a staffer on budget issues for a decade. In 1975, he ran for and won a seat on the [[Monterey County, California|Monterey County]] [[Board of Supervisors]].

In 1980 he was elected to the California State Assembly, where he became a champion for the organics industry and wrote one of the country’s strictest oil spill liability laws. He served in the Assembly until his election to Congress in 1993. {{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}

[[File:rep sam farr.jpg|thumb|left|Earlier photo of Congressman Farr]]
Farr was elected to the House of Representatives in 1993 through a special election when former Congressman Leon Panetta resigned to become President Clinton’s budget director. Farr was elected to his first full term in 1994.

===Legislation===
*Farr introduced the “Oceans Conservation, Education, and National Strategy for the 21st century Act” ([http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:hr21: H.R. 21]) in January 2007. The bill would consolidate national management of oceans, creating a system of regional governance; make the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration the chief oceans agency; creates an ocean advisor in the president’s Cabinet; creates regional and national ocean advisory committees; and create an Oceans and Great Lakes Conservation Trust Fund. It received a subcommittee markup in April 2008 and passed by a vote of 11–3.<ref>[http://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS142606+06-Mar-2008+MW20080306] "Ocean Champions Community Pushes for OCEANS-21 Bill," ''Reuters''.</ref>
*Farr's "Reconstruction and Stabilization Civilian Management Act of 2008" ([http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:hr21: H.R. 1084]) was approved by the House but stalled in the Senate. The bill would create capacity within the State Department to quickly deploy civilian expertise and coordinate the government response to crises abroad. President [George W. Bush] supports the program and approved initial creation of the group. Farr participated in a rollout of the group with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice in July 2008.<ref>[http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2008/07/107083.htm] "Remarks At the Civilian Response Corps Rollout," State Department.</ref>

===Caucus work===
[[File:Jack and Sam Farr.png|thumb|Sam Farr meets with [[Jack O'Neill (businessman)|Jack O'Neill]]]] Farr is active in several congressional caucuses, including the House Oceans Caucus, the Congressional Travel and Tourism Caucus, the Congressional Bike Caucus, the Congressional Organic Caucus, the [[United States Congressional International Conservation Caucus|International Conservation Caucus]], and the Unexploded Ordnance Caucus.<ref>[http://www.farr.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=147&Itemid=39] Congressman Farr's Caucuses</ref>

He serves as co-chair of the Congressional Travel and Tourism Caucus with Rep. [[Roy Blunt]] (R-Missouri). Farr has taken an active role in supporting the travel industry, boosting membership in the caucus to more than 100 and hosting caucus events, including a June 2008 gathering of travel executives and congressional leaders, the Economic Roundtable: Travel’s Significance to the U.S. Economy.<ref>[http://www.politickernv.com/jkcooper/1942/porter-farr-host-travel-and-tourism-economic-roundtable] "Porter, Farr Host Travel and Tourism Economic Roundtable."</ref>

Farr is also active as co-chair of the House Oceans Caucus, which he co-chairs with four other members of Congress. Each year the caucus helps sponsor Capitol Hill Oceans Week, known as CHOW, which draws hundreds of ocean experts from across the country. He is also co-chair of the Congressional Organic Caucus and the Unexploded Ordnance Caucus.

===Other leadership positions===
Farr serves on the [http://hdac.house.gov House Democracy Assistance Commission], a group established by the House of Representatives mandated to work with emerging democracies throughout the world. The group engages in “peer-to-peer cooperation to build technical expertise in partner legislatures that will enhance accountability, transparency, legislative independence, access to information, and government oversight.”<ref>[http://hdac.house.gov/]</ref>

*He received a perfect 100% rating for the 110th, 111th, and 112th United States Congress from the [[Human Rights Campaign]].<ref name="HRC Scorecard">{{cite web|url=http://www.hrc.org/files/assets/resources/112thCongressionalScorecard_2012.pdf|title=Human Rights Campaign Scorecard|accessdate=October 21, 2012}}</ref>

===Domestic Issues===
[[File:Sam Farr, official portrait, 111th Congress.jpg|thumb|left|Sam Farr]]
*Oceans. Farr is a proponent of ocean protection and conservation. In addition to H.R. 21, Farr has introduced the Southern Sea Otter Recovery and Research Act ([http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:hr3639: H.R. 3639]) and the Clean Cruise Ship Act ([http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:hr6434: H.R. 6434]).
*Gas prices. Farr opposes opening new areas to offshore drilling, instead supporting the drilling of {{convert|68000000|acre|km2}} of federally owned land already under lease, including {{convert|33000000|acre|km2}} on the Outer Continental Shelf. Farr also supports ending subsidies to oil companies.<ref>[http://thecalifornian.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080731/NEWS01/807310304/1002] "Poll: Residents back oil drilling off state's coast," Salinas Californian"</ref>
*Base Realignment and Closure. Farr has worked closely with Central Coast cities and the Army on the reuse of the former Fort Ord. He was integral in securing $29 million for the creation of California State University-Monterey Bay. He also played a role in making sure land on the former installation included significant amounts of affordable housing.
*Immigration. Farr supports comprehensive immigration reform that includes a guest worker program for farm workers, allowing [[undocumented students]] to remain in the country (known as the [[DREAM Act]]), and deporting undocumented felons in U.S. jails.<ref>[http://www.farr.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=418] Immigration (Summer 2008 E-Newsletter)</ref>

===Foreign Affairs===

*Iraq. Farr has consistently opposed the war in Iraq. He voted against the “Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002” that started the war. Farr is a cosponsor on several bills including [http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:hres1329: H.Res. 1329], which supports a timetable for troop withdrawal, and [http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:hr5626: H.R. 5626] and [http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:hr4959: H.R 4959], which call for congressional approval for any long-term agreements with Iraq.<ref>[http://www.farr.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=411 Iraq and Iran (Summer 2008 E-Newsletter)]</ref>
*Iran. Farr has been vocal in efforts to prevent military action against Iran. He is a cosponsor of H. Con. Res 33, which would require congressional approval before any incursion into Iran, and [http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:hr3119: H.R. 3119], a bill to prohibit the use of funds for military operations in Iran.
*Colombia. Farr has parlayed his experience in Colombia to become a congressional leader on Colombian affairs. He was an active supporter of rebalancing funds dedicated to Plan Colombia, the U.S. anti-drug effort, to include more support for economic redevelopment efforts. He has hosted a wide range of Colombian political leaders in his Washington office including current President Álvaro Uribe and former President Andrés Pastrana.

===Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) comment===
On February 26, 2008, at the [[United States House Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security|House Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee]] hearing, Farr said "the public image of (the ICE agents)" has become "not (a) compassionate law enforcement agency but essentially a [[Gestapo]]-type agency that is knocking down doors"<ref name="Salinas lawmaker attacked over Gestapo remark">{{cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/centralcoast/ci_8434872?nclick_check=1|title=Salinas lawmaker attacked over Gestapo remark|accessdate=March 7, 2008}}</ref> when conducting raids on illegal immigrants. [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement|Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] [[Julie Myers]] responded to Farr's comments by saying, "We are not the Gestapo. The men and women of this agency have a very difficult job...and I think they do that with distinction and great honor.".<ref name="House panel urges faster deportation of jailed illegal immigrants">{{cite web|url=http://www.govexec.com/story_page.cfm?articleid=39368&dcn=todaysnews|title=House panel urges faster deportation of jailed illegal immigrants|accessdate=February 26, 2008}}</ref> Farr replied that he knew and appreciated this, but reiterated that there is "there is a very ill will public opinion in the counties (he) represent(s), about ICE".

===H.Res. 333===
On July 12, 2007, Farr joined 11 cosponsors (18 as of August 15, 2007) of H.Res. 333, introduced in Congress, that lays out three articles of impeachment against Vice President [[Dick Cheney]]. The bill maintains that the vice president purposely manipulated the intelligence process to deceive the citizens and Congress of the United States (1) by fabricating a threat of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction and (2) about an alleged relationship between Iraq and al Qaeda in order to justify the use of the United States Armed Forces against the nation of Iraq in a manner damaging to our national security interests and (3) that Cheney has openly threatened aggression against the Republic of Iran absent any real threat to the United States. (see http://thomas.loc.gov for more details on H.Res. 333)

"Many residents in the Central Coast support the removal of Cheney from office, and I am proud to represent their values in Congress," Farr said in a brief statement.<ref>[http://www.montereyherald.com/ci_6355617?nclick_check=1]</ref>

==Awards==
On July 30, 2007, Farr received the Senator David Pryor Special Achievement Award for his ongoing advocacy for communities with military bases presented by the Association of Defense Communities. The award is given to an individual who advocates for communities with active or closed military bases. "Communities with active or closed military bases face many special concerns, from land use to economic development to ordnance disposal," said Farr. "I have been lucky enough to assist in the transition efforts at Fort Ord, and that experience has helped me push those issues locally and nationwide." As vice-chair of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction, Farr successfully increased clean-up funds from $221 million to $271 million for military bases closed prior to 2005 [http://thecalifornian.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070730/NEWS01/70730017/1002].
