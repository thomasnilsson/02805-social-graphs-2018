==Early political career==
In 1969-70, Blumenauer organized and led Oregon's "Go 19" campaign, an effort to lower the state voting age (while then unsuccessful it supported the national trend which soon resulted in the [[Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] which lowered the voting age to 18). In 1972, he was elected to the [[Oregon House of Representatives]] as a Democrat representing District 11 in [[Multnomah County, Oregon|Multnomah County]].<ref>[http://arcweb.sos.state.or.us/pages/records/legislative/recordsguides/histleg/statehood/1973reg.html 1973 Regular Session (57th).] Oregon State Archives.

In the [[Political effects of Hurricane Katrina|political aftermath of Hurricane Katrina]] Blumenauer noted that he was among those who had pointed out the vulnerability of New Orleans and encouraged Congress to help that city and the gulf coast get better prepared:
*September 15, 2004: [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Mr. Speaker]], barely have we recovered from [[Hurricane Hugo]] and we are seeing Hurricane Ivan pose the threat that has long been feared by those in Louisiana, that this actually might represent the loss of the City of New Orleans. Located 15 feet below sea level, there is the potential of a 30-foot wall of water putting at risk $100 billion of infrastructure and industry and countless lives.<ref>[http://blumenauer.house.gov/Issues/FloorSpeechSummary.aspx?NewsID=1115&IssueID=17 Congressman Earl Blumenauer's Website, Representing the 3rd Congressional District of Oregon<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
*January 26, 2005: Mr. Speaker, I recently had the opportunity to view the devastation in Southeast Asia as a result of the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake|tsunami]]. As appalled as I was by what I saw, I must confess that occasionally my thoughts drifted back to the United States. What would have happened if last September, [[Hurricane Ivan]] had veered 40 miles to the west, devastating the city of New Orleans? One likely scenario would have had a tsunami-like 30-foot wall of water hitting the city, causing thousands of deaths and $100 billion in damage...The experience of Southeast Asia should convince us all of the urgent need for congressional action to prevent wide-scale loss of life and economic destruction at home and abroad. Prevention and planning will pay off. Maybe the devastation will encourage us to act before disaster strikes.<ref>[http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2005/9/4/233718/2082 Daily Kos: DAMNING Congressional Record: Cries for Help Ignored By The Federal Government [updated&#93;<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Blumenauer is a supporter of the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO)<ref>[http://blumenauer.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1014&Itemid=160 "U.S. Should Remain Active in the WTO,"] Rep.

In February 2009, after an incident in [[Connecticut]] wherein a domesticated [[chimpanzee]] severely mauled a woman gained national attention, Blumenauer sponsored the Captive Primate Safety Act to bar the sale or purchase of non-human [[primate]]s for personal possession between states and from outside of the country.<ref>{{cite web | work=OpenCongress | title=H.R.80 Captive Primate Safety Act | url=http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-h80/show}}</ref> The previous year, in June 2008, Blumenauer had sponsored legislation to ban interstate trafficking of [[great ape]]s, which had passed in the House but been tabled by the [[United States Senate|Senate]].<ref>{{cite news | agency=The Oregonian | first=Charles | last=Pope | title=House passes Blumenauer bill to restrict primate sales | date=February 24, 2009 | url=http://www.oregonlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2009/02/house_passes_blumenauer_bill_t.html}}</ref>

Blumenauer has received some media attention during the [[Health care reform debate in the United States|political debate]] over [[Health care reform in the United States|health care reform]] for sponsoring an amendment to the [[America's Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009]] to change current procedures to mandate that [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] pay for [[End-of-life (medical treatment)|end-of-life]] counseling.<ref>{{cite news | agency=The Associated Press | first=Ricardo | last=Alonso-Zaldivar | title=It's alive!

His rebuke was echoed by Republican Senator [[Johnny Isakson]] of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], who scorned the "death panels" claim as "nuts".<ref>{{cite news | first=Matthew | last=Daly | date=August 14, 2009 | agency=Associated Press | url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Palin+stands+by+%27death+panel%27+claim-a01611965921 | title=Palin stands by 'death panel claim}}</ref>

On July 24, 2014, Blumenauer introduced the [[Emergency Afghan Allies Extension Act of 2014 (H.R. 5195; 113th Congress)]], a bill that would authorize an additional 1,000 emergency Special Immigrant Visas that the [[United States Department of State]] could issue to Afghan translators who served with U.S. troops during the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|War in Afghanistan]].<ref name=5195sum>{{cite web|title=H.R. 5195 - Summary|url=https://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/5195|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=1 August 2014}}</ref><ref name=BlumenauerPR1>{{cite web|title=Blumenauer, Kinzinger Hail Passage of the Emergency Afghan Allies Extension Act|url=http://blumenauer.house.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/2375-blumenauer-kinzinger-hail-passage-of-passage-of-the-emergency-afghan-allies-extension-act|publisher=House Office of Earl Blumenauer|accessdate=1 August 2014}}</ref> Blumenauer argued that "a failure to provide these additional visas ensures the many brave translators the U.S. promised to protect in exchange for their services would be left in Afghanistan, hiding, their lives still threatened daily by the Taliban."<ref name="BlumenauerPR1"/>
