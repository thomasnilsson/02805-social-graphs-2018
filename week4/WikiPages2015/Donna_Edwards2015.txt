===2006===
{{Main|United States House of Representatives elections in Maryland, 2006}}
Edwards challenged seven-term incumbent [[Al Wynn]] in the 2006 Democratic primary - the real contest in this heavily Democratic, black-majority district. Edwards focused primarily on Wynn's voting record. Wynn, considered a conservative by African-American Democratic standards, was one of four Congressional Black Caucus members that voted for the 2002 Iraq War resolution. Edwards condemned the war before it started. Wynn eventually began to say he was misled by the Bush Administration and his vote was a mistake. Edwards opposed the [[Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001|repeal of the estate tax]], which Wynn voted for. Similarly, Edwards criticized Wynn's vote for the [[Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act|bankruptcy bill of 2005]], which eliminated some bankruptcy protections for individuals. Wynn supported the energy bill promoted by Vice President and former Halliburton CEO Dick Cheney. Wynn opposed the net neutrality bill of 2006, which Edwards supports.

On August 16, 2006, before a debate at [[Prince George's Community College]], an altercation occurred between Wynn's staffers and an Edwards volunteer, leaving the volunteer with a bloody gash to the head.<ref name=altercation>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/17/AR2006081701531.html|title=Supporters Scuffle At Candidate Forum|date=2006-08-18|accessdate=2008-03-13|work=[[Washington Post]]|first=Ovetta|last=Wiggins}}</ref> This event brought much media attention to the race.

On August 30, 2006, the ''[[Washington Post]]'' endorsed Edwards in the primary race.<ref name=WaPoEndorsement>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/29/AR2006082901302.html|title=For Congress in Maryland|date=2006-08-30|accessdate=2008-03-13|work=[[Washington Post]]}}</ref>

The primary was held on September 12, 2006. Wynn defeated Edwards by 49.7 percent to 46.4 percent, with a margin of 2,725 votes out of more than 82,000 cast. George McDermott, a little-known candidate, took 3.9 percent.<ref name=primary2006>{{cite web|url=http://www.elections.state.md.us/elections/2006/results/primary/office_Representative_in_Congress.html|title=REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS Results|work=Maryland State Board of Elections|accessdate=2008-03-13}}</ref> The final tally of the primary was unclear for nearly two weeks because of widespread voting problems on new electronic voting machines in Montgomery and Prince George's counties.<ref name=votingproblems>{{cite news|url=http://www.cqpolitics.com/2006/09/prolonged_vote_count_in_md_4_e.html |title=Prolonged Vote Count in Md. 4 Ends With Victory for Wynn|first=Brendan|last=Spiegal|date=2006-09-25|accessdate=2008-03-13|work=CQPolitics.com |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061027152806/http://www.cqpolitics.com/2006/09/prolonged_vote_count_in_md_4_e.html |archivedate = 2006-10-27}}</ref>

{{Main|United States House of Representatives elections in Maryland, 2008|Maryland's 4th congressional district special election, 2008}}
In 2008, Edwards again challenged Wynn for his seat in the [[United States House of Representatives elections in Maryland, 2008|Democratic primary]]. During the 2008 campaign, Edwards accused Wynn of being out of touch with the community and of accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars of corporate money. Wynn counter-attacked Edwards as hypocritical, citing the fact that she served as executive director of the Arca Foundation, an organization that has invested millions of dollars in oil and gas companies.<ref name=lobbyists>{{cite news|url=http://cqpolitics.com/wmspage.cfm?parm1=5&docID=news-000002652921|title=Challenger Seeks to Dramatize Rep.

[[File:Donna Edwards at victory rally, February 13, 2008.jpg|thumb|right|Edwards at her victory rally on February 13, 2008]]

In the February 12, 2008, primary, Edwards defeated the eight-term incumbent in a rout, taking 60% of the vote to Wynn's 35%. The win virtually assured her of victory in the heavily Democratic district in November.<ref name="WaPoPrimary">{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/12/AR2008021202882.html|title=Edwards overpowers Wynn|first=Rosalind|last=Helderman|date=2008-02-13|accessdate=2008-06-19|work=[[Washington Post]]}}</ref>

After the primary, Wynn announced he would retire effective June 2008. Edwards won the Democratic nomination for the June 17, 2008, [[Maryland's 4th congressional district special election, 2008|special election]] to serve out the last six months of Wynn's term.<ref name="Edwards">[http://blog.washingtonpost.com/annapolis/2008/04/edwards_not_only_dem_intereste.html ''Washington Post'': "Edwards Not Only Dem Interested in District 4".]</ref>

Edwards won the backing of the [[Montgomery County, Maryland]], Democratic Party Central Committee April 22, 2008, by a 22 to 1 margin. Two days later, the [[Prince George's County]] Democratic Party Central Committee also recommended Edwards, this by a 17 to 0 vote on April 24, 2008.

As expected, Edwards easily won the special election, taking 81 percent of the vote over [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Peter James and [[Libertarian Party of the United States|Libertarian]] Thibeaux Lincecum.<ref name="MD BoE">[http://www.elections.state.md.us/elections/2008/2008_special_4th_congressional_general_results.html Maryland Board of Elections: 2008 Special 4th Congressional General Election Official Results.]</ref> She took office two days later, giving her a leg-up on seniority over any new congresspersons who were elected in 2008.

Edwards ran for a full term in November 2008 and was an overwhelming favorite; a Republican has never tallied more than 25 percent of the vote in the 4th district since it assumed its current configuration after the 1990 Census.<ref>Helderman, Rosalind.[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/06/12/AR2008061203941.html "A GOP Congressional Candidate's Lonely Voice"]. ''[[Washington Post]]'', 2008-06-13.</ref> Indeed, many of the 4th district's residents already thought of her as the district's congresswoman even before the special election.<ref name="special-election-win"/> As expected, Edwards easily won a full term with 85 percent of the vote, one of the highest percentages in the nation for a Democrat facing major-party opposition.<ref name="2008win"/>

===2010===

Edwards won against Delegate [[Herman L. Taylor, Jr.]] in the September, 2010, primary.
