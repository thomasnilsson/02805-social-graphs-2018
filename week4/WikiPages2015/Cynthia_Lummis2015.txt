Her siblings are Christine, Claudia, and Dell and his wife Sally Lummis, all of Cheyenne.

==Personal life==
Lummis is a [[lawyer]] and [[rancher]] in [[Cheyenne, Wyoming|Cheyenne]].  She manages Lummis Livestock, located outside Cheyenne, which began in 1919 when her great-grandfather, the owner of a hardware store, bought the property from a business partner.  The ranch has a stone [[barn]] built in the latter 19th century. Lummis and Wiederspahn also own ranches in [[Wheatland, Wyoming|Wheatland]] and in [[Lincoln County, Wyoming|Lincoln County]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}

Although she uses her maiden name, she was married from 1983 until his death in 2014 to Cheyenne attorney and businessman [[Alvin Wiederspahn|Alvin Laramie "Al" Wiederspahn]], himself a Democratic former member of both houses of the Wyoming legislature. The two were House colleagues from 1979 to 1983, when they married. The Wiederspahns have a daughter, Annaliese Wiederspahn. Lummis attends Trinity Lutheran Church in Cheyenne, of which her husband was an elder. Lummis's father-in-law was former Laramie County [[Coroner]] Arling Wiederspahn (1916–2007), a Democrat, a funeral home owner, and a leading civic builder of Cheyenne.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}

Her affiliations include the American Women's Financial Education Foundation, the Center for the Rocky Mountain West Advisory Board, Cheyenne's Vision 2020, the Wyoming Business Alliance, and the Wyoming Stock Growers Agricultural Land Trust.  She is the first woman to have served on the popular [[Cheyenne Frontier Days]] [[Rodeo]] Board. She won the title "Miss Frontier" in 1976. In 2003, Lummis was a fundraiser for the construction of Johnson Lummis Hunkins Plaza in Downtown Laramie in [[Albany County, Wyoming|Albany County]],  where a statue has been erected in honor of [[Louisa Ann Swain|Louisa Gardner Swain]], the first woman ever to have voted in a general election in the United States.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}

Lummis appeared on ''The [[Colbert Report]]'' on March 9, 2009, as part of the show's recurring [[Better Know a District]] segment, which often lampoons members of the U.S. Congress. The segment dealt with [[cougar]]s, or mountain lions, with Colbert asking if [[Wyoming]] had a cougar problem, while alluding to the slang use of the term "[[Cougar (slang)|cougar]]".{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}

In 2008, Lummis reported her wealth as ranging from $20 million to $75 million. In 2010, she reported $5.5 million and $24 million each. She ranked in 2010 as the twenty-ninth wealthiest member of Congress.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}  Most of Lummis’ wealth is derived from her family-owned Arp and Hammond Company, Lummis Livestock Company, and Old Horse Pasture Inc.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wyofile.com/2011/12/wyoming-delegation-rep-cynthia-lummis-among-richest-members-of-congress/|title=Rep.
