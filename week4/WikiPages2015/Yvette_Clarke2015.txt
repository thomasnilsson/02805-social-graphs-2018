'''Yvette Diane Clarke''' (born November 21, 1964) is a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] member of the  [[United States House of Representatives|US House of Representatives]] from [[New York]]. She is ranking member of the [[United States House Homeland Security Subcommittee on Emerging Threats, Cybersecurity, Science and Technology|Homeland Security Subcommittee on Emerging Threats, Cybersecurity, Science and Technology]]. Clark's district was numbered the [[New York's 11th congressional district|11th district]] from 2007 to 2013, and redistricted as the [[New York's 9th congressional district|9th district]] in 2013 covering much of central Brooklyn.

Before entering Congress in 2007, Clarke was a member of the [[New York City Council]], representing the 40th council district in [[Brooklyn]], succeeding her mother, Una S. T. Clarke.<ref name=CUNY/>

==Early life and education==
The child of [[Jamaica]]n immigrant parents, Clarke has lived all her life in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Flatbush{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}. Upon graduating from [[Edward R. Murrow High School]], she earned a scholarship{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} to [[Oberlin College]] in [[Ohio]], which she attended from 1982 to 1986. She then enrolled at [[Medgar Evers College]],<ref name=DN/> but did not graduate.<ref name=newC/>

==Early career==
Clarke worked as director of [[business development]] for [[the Bronx]] Overall Economic Development Corporation and was the second director of the Bronx portion of the New York City Empowerment Zone.<ref>VoteNY, [http://vote-ny.org/Intro.aspx?State=NY&Id=nyclarkeyvetted Biography: Yvette D. Clarke], 2012</ref> At some point, she interned for Congressman [[Major Owens]].<ref name=Cap>{{cite news|url=http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/politics/2013/10/8534884/major-owens-dies-77|title=Major Owens dies at 77|date=Oct 22, 2013}}</ref>

==New York City Council==
Brooklyn's 40th council district elected Clarke to the New York City Council in 2001. She succeeded her mother, former City Council member Una S. T. Clarke,<ref name=CUNY>{{cite web|url=http://www1.cuny.edu/mu/forum/2010/02/17/congresswoman-yvette-clarke-discusses-federal-job-policy-former-rep-major-owens-reflects-on-the-life-of-shirley-chisholm-on-urban-focus-january-17/|title=CONGRESSWOMAN YVETTE CLARKE DISCUSSES FEDERAL JOB POLICY, FORMER REP. MAJOR OWENS REFLECTS ON THE LIFE OF SHIRLEY CHISHOLM ON URBAN FOCUS, FEBRUARY 17|publisher=CUNY website}}</ref> who held the seat for more than a decade, making theirs the first mother-to-daughter succession in city council.

As a member of the Council, she instituted an [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] Task Force, a Sanitation Task Force, a Youth Task Force and organized an Ad Hoc Clergy Committee. She was chair of the Contracts Committee and was also co-chair of the Council's Women's Caucus. She also served on a number of other committees.

Clarke is an advocate for the empowerment of women and minorities and introduced legislation that resulted in the Council's Minority & Women-Owned Business Empowerment (MWBE) study that that found women and minority-owned businesses are not awarded their fair share of city contracts. This finding forced New York City to end its system of economic discrimination.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} As co-chair of the New York Council's Women's Caucus, Clarke secured $9.5 million in funding for organizations that addressed the issues of domestic violence prevention, breast cancer awareness, housing and HIV/AIDS counseling for women.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

She cosponsored City Council resolutions that opposed the [[Iraq War|war in Iraq]], criticized the federal [[USA PATRIOT Act]], and called for a national moratorium on the [[death penalty]]. She was a frequent critic of the [[George W. Bush|Bush]] administration's policies, and opposed budget cuts by Bush and the Republican Congress on several programs addressing women's rights and poverty.  Perhaps contradictorily, she later voted to extend provisions of the Patriot Act after the election of President Barack Obama.<ref>{{cite news|author= |url=http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/members/C001067/key-votes/page2/ |title=The U.S. Congress Votes Database |publisher=The Washington Post |accessdate=2 December 2012}}</ref>

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Policy positions===

'''Abortion'''

Clarke is [[pro-choice]] and during her tenure in the House of Representatives has consistently voted against legislation that would place restrictions on abortion rights, including voting against passage of the [[No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act]] of 2011, which sought to prohibit federal funds from being allocated to cover abortions.<ref name="votesmart.org">http://votesmart.org/candidate/key-votes/44741/yvette-clarke#.UKsVZ4dJOAg</ref>  Her voting record in support of abortion rights has led interest groups such as [[NARAL]] Pro-Choice America and [[Planned Parenthood]] to give her high ratings (100% each) while her ratings from pro-life organizations like the [[National Right to Life Committee]] have been correspondingly low (0%) within the last two years.<ref name="ReferenceA">http://votesmart.org/candidate/evaluations/44741/yvette-clarke#.UKsHS4dJOAh</ref>

'''Budget, Spending and Tax Issues'''

She received a 92% rating from the ''[[National Journal]]'' for being liberal on economic policy in 2011, while she received a low 15% rating from the [[National Tax Payers Union]] for her positions on tax and spending in 2011 and a 2% rating from the [[Citizens Against Government Waste]] in 2010.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> She has consistently opposed legislation which seeks to reduce government spending and cut taxes, including voting against the Job Protection and Recession Prevention Act of 2012 which sought to extend tax cuts established during [[George W. Bush]]'s administration through the end of 2013.<ref name="votesmart.org"/>

'''Environmental Policy'''

Clarke received 100 percent ratings from Environment America, the [[League of Conservation Voters]], and the [[Sierra Club]], the latter on her clean water positions, in 2011 while she received a low rating of 14% over the period 2008–2011 from the Global Exchange for her loyalty to the finance, insurance, and real estate lobbies.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>   Clarke has opposed legislation which gives priority to economic over conservation interests, such as the Stop the War on Coal Act of 2012 and the Conservation and Economic Growth Act of 2012, while she has supported legislation which increases conservation efforts and government regulation of industry, such as the Offshore Drilling Regulations and Other Energy Law Amendments Act of 2010.<ref name="votesmart.org"/>

===In the media===
On the ''[[Colbert Report]]'', in its "[[Better Know a District]]" segment in early September 2012, when [[Stephen Colbert]] asked the three-term congresswoman what she'd have changed back in 1898 (the year Brooklyn merged with New York City) if she could go back in time, the congresswoman responded the abolition of slavery. Colbert responded, "Slavery…Really? I didn't realize there was slavery in Brooklyn in 1898," (Slavery was abolished in New York state in 1827.<ref name=news1/>) Clarke responded immediately with, "I'm pretty sure there was" stating that the Dutch owned slaves in New York in 1898.<ref name=news1/><ref name=news1>{{cite news|url=http://newsone.com/2034297/yvette-clarke-slavery-gaffe-colbert-report/|title=Brooklyn Democrat Makes Slavery Gaffe On 'The Colbert Report'|date=Sep 5, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2012/09/yvette_clark.php|title=Congresswoman Yvette Clarke On The 1898 Dutch Enslavement Of Brooklyn (That Never Actually Happened)|last=King|first=James|date=Sep 5, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/history-errors-article-1.1152362|title=Rep.

===Tenure===
In April 2007, Clarke was the sole member of Congress to oppose a bill authored by a Bronx Democrat that renamed the Ellis Island Library after British-born [[Bob Hope]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/30/15/30_15hopeless.html | title=No Hope for Yvette | publisher=[[The Brooklyn Paper]] | date=2007-04-14 | accessdate=2008-11-07 | author=Rizk, Christie}}</ref>

On September 29, 2008, she voted in support of HR 3997, the Emergency Economic Stability Act of 2008. The act failed, 205–228. She also wrote legislation written to improve the process of getting names off the [[No Fly List]].  It was passed 413–3 on February 3, 2009.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.house.gov/list/press/ny11_clarke/021009.shtml | title=Rep. Yvette D. Clarke's FAST Redress Act Passes the U.S. House of Representatives | publisher=United States House of Representatives | date=February 4, 2009 | accessdate=September 10, 2012 | author=Sykes, Ronnie}}</ref>
In November 2009 she was one of 54 members of Congress that sent a letter urging President Obama to use diplomatic pressure to resolve the blockade affecting [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]]. She has since retracted her support of the letter.{{Why|date=April 2014}}

On March 25, 2010, she introduced the "[[Computer security#International Cybercrime Reporting and Cooperation Act|International Cybercrime Reporting and Cooperation Act – H.R.4962]]" before [[United States Congress|Congress]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-h4962/text | title=H.R.4962 – International Cybercrime Reporting and Cooperation Act | publisher=Open Congres Organization | date=March 25, 2010 | accessdate=September 10, 2012}}</ref>

Clarke supported the [[Prison Ship Martyrs' Monument Preservation Act (H.R. 1501; 113th Congress)]], a bill that would direct the [[United States Department of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] to study the suitability and feasibility of designating the [[Prison Ship Martyrs' Monument]] in [[Fort Greene Park]] in the [[New York City]] [[Borough (New York City)|borough]] of [[Brooklyn]] as a unit of the National Park System (NPS).<ref name=1501sum>{{cite web|title=H.R. 1501 – Summary|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/1501|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=1 May 2014}}</ref> Clarke argued that the bill was a good idea because "this monument commemorates not only the sacrifices of soldiers in the Revolutionary War who dedicated themselves to the cause of liberty, but a reminder than even in wartime we must protect basic human rights. These thousands of deaths were an atrocity that should never occur again."<ref name=ClarkePR>{{cite web|title=Congresswoman Clarke Urges Designation Prison Ship Martyrs Monument as a National Monument|url=http://clarke.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/congresswoman-clarke-urges-designation-prison-ship-martyrs-monument-as-a|publisher=Office of Yvette D. Clarke|accessdate=1 May 2014|date=29 April 2014}}</ref>

On September 17, 2013, Clarke introduced the [[Homeland Security Cybersecurity Boots-on-the-Ground Act (H.R. 3107; 113th Congress)]], a bill that would require the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS) to undertake several actions designed to improve the readiness and capacity of DHS's cybersecurity workforce.<ref name=3107sum>{{cite web|title=H.R. 3107 – Summary|url=https://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/3107|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=30 July 2014}}</ref><ref name=3107cbo>{{cite web|title=H.R. 3107 – CBO|url=http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/hr3107.pdf|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=30 July 2014}}</ref> DHS would also be required to create a strategy for recruiting and training additional cybersecurity employees.<ref name=FTmedici>{{cite news|last1=Medici|first1=Andy|title=House passes DHS cyber bills|url=http://www.federaltimes.com/article/20140729/CYBER/307290008/House-passes-DHS-cyber-bills?odyssey=nav%7Chead|accessdate=30 July 2014|publisher=Federal Times|date=29 July 2014}}</ref>

In 2000, her mother ran in the Democratic primary against U.S. Congressman [[Major Owens]], losing to him. In the 2004 election cycle, Yvette Clarke, with only two-and-a-half years' of service as an elected official, campaigned for the same seat, narrowly losing. Owens called these campaigns as well as Yvette's 2006 bid, "long-term double-cross and stab in the back" as Una Clarke and he had been allies,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/major-r-owens-former-congressman-dies-at-77/2013/10/22/692d7c00-3b31-11e3-b6a9-da62c264f40e_story.html|title=Major R. Owens, liberal congressman known as 'Rappin' Rep,' dies at 77|publisher=Washington Post|date=Oct 22, 2013|first=Adam|last=Bernstein}}</ref> and Yvette had interned for him.<ref name=Cap/>

===2006===
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in New York, 2006#11th District}}
In May 2006, another Caribbean-American candidate, Assemblyman [[N. Nick Perry]], withdrew from the race to succeed Congressman [[Major Owens]], leading some observers to contend that Clarke's chances for winning the race would improve now that another candidate from the same community was no longer competing.

In August 2006, the ''New York Daily News'' uncovered the fact that Clarke was misrepresenting her educational background in her campaign literature, stating that she had graduated from [[Oberlin College]].<ref name=NYO/> The paper found that she didn't complete her coursework at Oberlin and had subsequently enrolled at [[Medgar Evers College]], but did not graduate.<ref name=DN/><ref name=NYT>{{cite news|url=http://empirezone.blogs.nytimes.com/2006/08/23/yvette-clarkes-oberlin-education/?_r=0|title=Yvette Clarke's Oberlin Education|publisher=''New York Times'' | date=August 23, 2006}}</ref>  The questions of whether she had graduated and from which college were the subject of controversy during her 2006 campaign,<ref name=DN>Celeste Katz, New York Daily News, [http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/2006/08/yvettes-education.html Daily Politics: Yvette's Education], August 23, 2006</ref><ref name=NYO>New York Observer, [http://observer.com/2006/08/clarkes-diploma/ Clarke's Diploma], August 23, 2006</ref><ref name=NYT/><ref>Government Printing Office, [http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-CDOC-108hdoc224/pdf/GPO-CDOC-108hdoc224-4-1.pdf First-Term Black-American Members of the 110th Congress], 2007, page 1</ref><ref>Stephanie Gaskell, New York Post, [http://nypost.com/2006/08/24/fibbing-to-a-degree/ Fibbing to a Degree], August 24, 2006</ref> with her then-PR representative saying she attended Oberlin and finished at Medgar Evers — "case closed".<ref name=NYO/><ref name=NYT/> In 2011 another PR representative for the congresswoman told ''Crain's'' that the congresswoman had re-enrolled at Oberlin in order to complete the credits necessary for the awarding of her degree.<ref name=newC>''Crain's New York Business'', [http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20110302/INS/110309978 Clarke Still Seeking Diploma], March 2, 2011</ref>

On September 12, 2006, Clarke won the nomination to Congress with just 31.20% of the vote. (In multi-candidate congressional elections in New York, a plurality is sufficient to nominate.) This practically assured her of election in this overwhelmingly Democratic, black-majority district.  In the general election on November 7, Clarke was elected to the House of Representatives with 89% of the vote against token [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] opposition.

===2008===
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in New York, 2008}}
Clarke was re-elected on November 4, 2008 by a large margin.

===2010===
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in New York, 2010#District 11}}
Clarke was re-elected on November 2, 2010 by a large margin.

===2012===
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in New York, 2012#District 9}}
She had $50,000 in her campaign budget before the June primary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20120320/INS/120319885|title=Marty for Congress? Don't fuggedaboutit!|publisher=''Crains New York''}}</ref>
