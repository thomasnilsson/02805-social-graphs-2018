===Elections===
;1996
Holt first ran for Congress in 1996 in [[New Jersey's 12th congressional district]] after incumbent Republican congressman [[Dick Zimmer (New Jersey politician)|Dick Zimmer]] decided to run for the U.S. Senate. On June 4, 1996, Holt lost the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic party]] [[primary election|primary]], receiving 24% of the vote and finishing last of the three candidates. [[Lambertville, New Jersey|Lambertville]] Mayor David DelVecchio won the primary with 45% of the vote and Carl Mayer finished second with 31% of the vote.  Holt received the most votes in [[Mercer County, New Jersey|Mercer County]], while losing the other four counties in the district to DelVecchio and Mayer: DelVecchio won Monmouth, Hunterdon, and Somerset Counties while Mayer won Middlesex County.<ref>http://www.state.nj.us/state/elections/election-results/1996-primary-election-results-house.pdf</ref> DelVecchio went on to lose the general election to Republican [[Michael Pappas]].<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=375284</ref>

;1998
Holt decided to run again in 1998. On June 2, 1998, Holt won the Democratic primary, defeating Carl Mayer 64% to 36%.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=375285</ref><ref name="state.nj.us">http://www.state.nj.us/state/elections/election-results/1998-pri-elect-results-us-house.pdf</ref> Holt challenged one-term Congressman Michael Pappas. The incumbent's campaign experienced a setback after he read a poem, set to the tune of "[[Twinkle Twinkle Little Star]]", praising [[Kenneth Starr]] on the floor of the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. Holt defeated Pappas by 4 percentage points, 51% to 47%, becoming the first Democrat to represent the district in two decades. Holt won Mercer (61%) and Middlesex (60%) while losing Monmouth (48%), Hunterdon (37%), and Somerset (40%).<ref name="state.nj.us"/><ref>[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2519/is_4_20/ai_54709845/pg_1 "Twinkle, twinkle Kenneth Starr: how physicist Rush Holt used the Clinton scandal to oust a Republican congressman"], ''Campaigns & Elections'', May 1999</ref><ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=27173</ref>

;2000
Holt was challenged by former Republican Congressman [[Dick Zimmer (New Jersey politician)|Dick Zimmer]] in the [[United States House elections, 2000|2000 election]]. Holt's prior win was thought by Republicans to be a fluke, and the race attracted considerable money and advertising. The election was hotly contested and the winner was not known on election day. Zimmer was ahead on election night by just a few votes, but Holt was ahead the next day. Ten days after the election, Holt declared himself the winner by 481 votes. Zimmer challenged the results, but conceded after the count began to go against him.<ref>[http://transcripts.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/11/29/nj.house.ap/index.html CNN.com — Zimmer concedes congressional race in N.J. after 22 days], November 29, 2000</ref><ref>[http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/archives/2002/09/25/page3/ ''The Daily Princetonian'' — Page 3], September 25, 2002</ref> Holt ultimately won the election by a margin of 651 votes: 146,162 votes for Holt (48.730%) compared to Zimmer's 145,511 (48.513%), making it the only general election where Holt has not received a majority of the votes in the election. Holt won Mercer (61%) and Middlesex (56%) while losing Monmouth (48%), Hunterdon (35%), and Somerset (37%).<ref>http://www.state.nj.us/state/elections/election-results/2000-general-elect-house-candidate-tallies.pdf</ref><ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=565</ref>

;2002
After [[redistricting]], Holt's district became much safer, in part by adding much of [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]]. While Holt faced a fairly well-funded challenge from [[Secretary of State of New Jersey]] [[DeForest Soaries|Buster Soaries]], a Republican. He defeated Soaries 61% to 38%. He won all five counties: Mercer (68%), Middlesex (63%), Somerset (54%), Hunterdon (54%), and Monmouth (52%).<ref>http://www.state.nj.us/state/elections/election-results/2002gen-elect-us-house-candidate_tally.pdf</ref><ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=1221</ref>

;2012
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in New Jersey, 2012#District 12}}
After redistricting in 2011, the 12th District became considerably more Democratic.

Additionally, sections of [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]], [[Franklin Township, Somerset County, New Jersey|Franklin Township]] & [[Old Bridge Township, New Jersey|Old Bridge Township]]
which were formerly located in the 4th and 6th Congressional districts, respectively, were also added to the 12th district. Only four counties remained: Mercer, Somerset, Middlesex, and now Union.

Holt won re-election to an 8th term, defeating Republican businessman Eric Beck 69% to 29%. He won all four counties Mercer (77%), Union (73%), Somerset (69%), and Middlesex (62%).<ref>http://www.state.nj.us/state/elections/2012-results/2012-official-general-results-house-of-representatives-1212.pdf</ref> On February 18th, 2014, Rush Holt announced that he will not be running for re-election to the House of Representatives in 2014.

A September 2012 [[Nature]] article features Holt and his rare background as a research scientist: "[Holt] thinks what is equally important is having more scientific thinking, even among the non-scientists in government...[Holt states], 'I'm more interested in the way that scientists are trained to deal with uncertainty, to deal with evidence and statistical reasoning, things that are lacking in the political debate.' When it comes to global warming, for instance, Representative Holt says we don't need people in Congress who understand atmospheric pressure, or glaciation. We simply need them to be open to the idea that evidence might disprove what they think they know.

Co-Chair of the [[Research and Development Caucus]], a member of the [[House Committee on Education and Labor]], and serving on the [[National Commission on Mathematics and Science Teaching for the 21st Century]], Holt has worked on crafting several comprehensive education policies. He helped write the [[College Cost Reduction Act]] - the largest college aid expansion bill since the [[GI bill]] - which drastically reduces student loan interest rates and includes Holt's provision to provide upfront tuition assistance for math, science, and foreign language teachers.<ref>{{cite web|last=Holt|first=Rush|title=Biography|url=http://holt.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=14&Itemid=5|publisher=Representative Rush Holt|accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref>  He also helped establish the "American Opportunity" tax credit to alleviate the burden of college tuition for low- and moderate-income students. Furthermore, Holt helped enact the [[Education Jobs and Medicaid Assistance Act]], which provides states with funding to reduce budget shortfalls and keep teachers in their classrooms.

For his significant legislative work on and support for all education initiatives, but also for legislation to strengthen national security through expansion and improvement of foreign language study, and to increase foreign language capacity in the U.S. intelligence community and throughout the federal government by expanding education in critical need foreign languages, Holt received the Foreign Language Advocacy Award from the Northeast Conference on the Teaching of Foreign Languages in 2005.<ref>{{cite web |title=The James W. Dodge Foreign Language Advocate Award |url=http://www.nectfl.org/awards-james-w-dodge-foreign-language-advocate-award |publisher=Northeast Conference on the Teaching of Foreign Languages |accessdate=August 28, 2014}}</ref>

On May 28, 2010, Holt voted in support of the Science and Technology Funding Bill (H.R. 5116), a bill passed in the House that provided funding for science and technology research and development purposes.<ref name="Key Votes"/>

Formerly the Assistant Director at [[Princeton University]]'s Plasma Physics Research Department, Holt has worked to promote involvement in programs of [[STEM fields]]. He successfully defended funding for the Department of Education’s Mathematics and Science Partnerships programs. As a result of Holt's efforts, he has been given an "A" rating by the [[National Education Association]] since 2007, along with a 100 percent approval rating by the [[National Association for College Admission Counseling]] in 2006, 2009–10, and 2011.

On January 22, 2013, ''Rush D. Holt, Jr.'', a [[Quaker]] and [[nuclear physicist]], introduced a [[United States Congress#Bills and resolutions|resolution]] to the [[United States Congress]] designating February 12, 2013 ([[Charles Darwin]]'s 204th birthday), as "[[Darwin Day]]" in order to recognize "the importance of [[sciences]] in the betterment of [[human]]ity".<ref name="NYT-20130201">{{cite news |last=Oppenheimer |first=Mark|title=Seeing Darwin Through Christian Eyes?

;Social issues
Holt states on his representative page, "Since coming to Congress, I have fought for fairness in health care coverage, worked to protect victims of domestic violence and sexual assault, supported equal pay for equal work, and sought gender equity in schools."<ref name="Issues - Women's Issues">{{cite web|last=Holt|first=Rush|title=Issues - Women's Issues|url=http://holt.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=37&Itemid=29|accessdate=17 November 2012}}</ref> He strongly believes in women's right to make decisions about their health care, without interference by the government, and upholds [[Roe v. Wade]].

Holt successfully opposed legislation that would have prevented access to birth control, eliminated funding for [[Title X]] (the national family planning program), and denied federal funding to [[Planned Parenthood]]. Planned Parenthood and the [[National Family Planning & Reproductive Health Association]] have consistently issued an approval rating of 100 percent for Holt since 1995, while the [[NARAL Pro-Choice America]] has rated Holt 100 percent since 1999.

Holt also sponsored the Helping Seniors Choose their Medicare Drug Plan Act (H.R. 3152), which increased the access that low-income healthcare recipients have to prescription drugs under Medicare and Medicaid. With the Protection Against Wrongful Voter Purges Act (H.R. 3835), Holt attempted to regulate the removal of voters’ names from eligibility lists to ensure the validity of those lists. With the Judicious Use of Surveillance Tools in Counterterrorism Efforts (JUSTICE) Act of 2009 (H.R. 4005), Holt increased limits on governmental power with respect to counterterrorism efforts.<ref name="Rush Holt">{{cite web
