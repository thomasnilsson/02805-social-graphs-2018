Alan Grayson Re-Elected"], theledger.com. Retrieved November 7, 2014.</ref>

==Early life and education==
Grayson was born in the [[The Bronx|Bronx]], [[New York City, New York]], to Dorothy Ann (née Sabin) and Daniel Franklin Grayson.<ref>http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~battle/reps/grayson.htm</ref><ref>http://www.tampabay.com/opinion/columns/on-ugly-words-and-ugly-history/1202483</ref> He graduated from [[Bronx High School of Science]] in 1975. Grayson worked his way through [[Harvard College]] as a [[janitor]] and [[Watchman (law enforcement)|nightwatchman]], and graduated with a [[Bachelors of Arts]] ''[[summa cum laude]]'' degree in economics in 1978.<ref name=bioguide/><ref name="House bio"/> After working two years as an economist, he returned to Harvard for graduate studies.<ref name="jews of capitol hill"/> In 1983, he earned a [[Juris Doctor]] ''[[magna cum laude]]'' from [[Harvard Law School]] and a [[Masters of Public Policy]] from the [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]]. Additionally, he completed some of the requirements for a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in government—the course work and passing the general exams.<ref name=bioguide/><ref name="oversighthearing"/> While in college Grayson was a member of the [[Phi Beta Kappa Society]].

Grayson wrote his [[Masters Thesis#North America|masters thesis]] on [[gerontology]] and in 1986, he helped found the non-profit [[Alliance for Aging Research]] in Washington, D.C., and served as an officer of the organization for more than twenty years.<ref name=aboutgrayson/>

==Law career==
Grayson worked as a [[law clerk]] at the [[Colorado Supreme Court]] in 1983,<ref name="shellie ruston"/> and at the [[D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals]] from 1984 to 1985, where he worked with two judges who later joined the [[U.S. Supreme Court]]: [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]] and [[Antonin Scalia]].<ref name="jews of capitol hill"/> He was an [[Associate attorney|associate]] at the Washington, D.C. firm of [[Fried Frank|Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson]] for five years, where he specialized in [[contract law]].

In 1991 he founded the law firm Grayson & Kubli, which concentrated on [[Government contracts|government contract]] law. He was a lecturer at the [[George Washington University]] government contracts program and a frequent speaker on the topic.<ref name="oversighthearing" /> In the 2000s, he worked as a plaintiffs' attorney specializing in [[whistleblower]] fraud cases aimed at [[Iraq war]] contractors. One contractor, [[Custer Battles]], employed individuals who were found guilty of making fraudulent statements and submitting fraudulent invoices on two contracts the company had with the [[Coalition Provisional Authority]] in Iraq.<ref name="appeal-ruling"/><ref name="wins-appeal"/> On behalf of his clients, Grayson filed suit under the [[False Claims Act]] and its ''[[qui tam]]'' provisions.<ref name="appeal-ruling"/> The jury verdict was more than $13 million, which was upheld on appeal in April 2009. The case remains the only successful prosecution of those who profited illegally from the war in Iraq. The Iraq war contractor fraud case brought Grayson his first national attention.<ref name="pinsky" /> In 2006, a ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' reporter described Grayson as "waging a one-man war against contractor fraud in Iraq" and as a "fierce critic of the war in Iraq" whose car displayed [[bumper stickers]] such as "Bush lied, people died".<ref name=wsj2006/>

==President of IDT Corp.==
Grayson made his fortune as the co-founder and first president of [[IDT Corporation]] (International Discount Telecom).<ref name=aboutgrayson /><ref name=secinfo/><ref>[http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/national/die-quickly-just-a-sample-of-alan-graysons-sound-bite-attack/1041022 'Die quickly' just a sample of Alan Grayson's sound bite attack]; Tampa Bay Times; October 2, 2009</ref>

{{Main|United States House of Representatives elections in Florida, 2010#District 8*}}
Grayson was challenged by Republican nominee [[Daniel Webster (Florida politician)|Daniel Webster]], Florida [[Tea Party movement|Tea Party]] backed Peg Dunmire, Independent George Metcalfe, and write-in [[Florida Whig Party]] candidate Steve Gerritzen.<ref name="candidate listing"/>

Grayson ran a September 2010, commercial calling Webster a "[[draft-dodger]]"<ref name="draft dodger"/> (Webster had received student deferments and a draft classification as medically unfit for service),<ref name="worst politician"/> and a later 30-second commercial calling Webster "[[Taliban]] Dan" and warning viewers that "Religious fanatics try to take away our freedom, in [[Afghanistan]], in [[Iran]] and right here in Central Florida."<ref name="ad compares"/> Grayson's ads were criticized for editing video mid-sentence to make Webster appear to be saying things he did not.<ref name="lowers bar"/><ref name="toned-down"/> Grayson released a toned-down version without the edited video or Taliban references in early October.<ref name="would force"/><ref name="rhetoric"/>

On [[Glenn Beck]]'s radio show, [[Sarah Palin]] agreed with a co-host's remark, "It's okay if the Republicans lose every seat in the Senate and the House except for one.

On November 6, 2012, Grayson defeated Todd Long 63%-37% to return to Congress after a one-term absence.

===Tenure===

====2009–2011====
Grayson was the second Democrat to represent Florida's 8th congressional district since its formation after the [[1970 United States Census|1970 census]] (it was the 5th District from 1973 to 1993 and has been the 8th since 1993). The only other Democrat to represent this district, [[Bill Gunter]], left to run for the [[United States Senate]] in 1974 after only one term.

Grayson is considered a [[progressivism|progressive]] Democrat. He supported [[Barack Obama]] in 2008. He was a member of the [[Congressional Progressive Caucus]], of which he was vice-chairman.<ref name="grijalva"/> Grayson twice joined Republicans to oppose the raising of the federal debt limit. He said, "We need to live within our means. We need to eliminate wasteful spending. If we did those two simple things, we would not need to raise the debt limit."<ref name="grayson fights"/>

On September 14, 2009, the U.S. House of Representatives passed H.RES 686, Grayson's "Teach the Constitution Week" bill. The bill urged high schools to spend one week each September teaching the [[United States Constitution]] to high school seniors and also encouraged students to petition the government on an issue of personal importance to them to demonstrate their understanding of their rights and responsibilities as citizens of the United States. The non-partisan resolution was passed by a voice vote and featured 222 co-sponsors.<ref name="Thomas.gov686"/><ref name="The Orlando Sentinel"/><ref name="house passes"/>

On the 40th anniversary of the historic [[Apollo 11]] moon landing in 1969, the U.S. House of Representatives passed Grayson's "New Frontier Congressional Gold Medal Act of 2009". The bill asked the president to present Congress's highest civilian honor, the [[Congressional Gold Medal]], to Apollo 11 astronauts [[Neil Armstrong]], [[Buzz Aldrin|Edwin "Buzz" Aldrin Jr.]], and [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]], as well as [[John Glenn]], the first American to orbit the Earth. Only about 200 medals have ever been awarded in the country's history. The New Frontier Congressional Gold Medal Act of 2009 passed the House unanimously on July 20, 2009.<ref name="gov track aug 2009"/><ref name="CoinNews.net"/>

;Legislation sponsored
*[[Pay for Performance Act]] (H.R. 1664)
*[[Public Option Act]] (H.R. 4789)
*[[War Is Making You Poor Act]] (H.R. 5353)
*[[Shareholder Protection Act]] (H.R. 4790)
*Paid Vacation Act of 2009 (H.R. 2564)

====2013–present====
Best known in his first term for making incendiary comments about Republicans, Grayson has focused on working with Republicans to pass amendments that "appeal to the libertarian streak in the GOP". He lobbies colleagues personally and in July 2013, [[David Weigel]] of ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' magazine called him "the most effective member of the House" and said that he was approaching "an unheralded title: The congressman who’s passed more amendments than any of his 434 peers".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/07/florida_democrat_alan_grayson_is_the_most_effective_member_of_the_house.html |title=The Congressman Formerly Known as Crazy |date=19 July 2013 |accessdate=23 July 2013 |publisher= Slate.com}}</ref>

In October 2013, his campaign sent out a fundraising email that compared the Tea Party to the [[Ku Klux Klan]]. It used the image of a burning cross as the "T" in Tea Party. Matt Gorman of the National Republican Congressional Committee described the e-mail as "hateful words and imagery". Grayson defended the comparison, saying that "here is overwhelming evidence that the Tea Party is the home of bigotry and discrimination in America today, just as the KKK was for an earlier generation."<ref>http://www.politico.com/story/2013/10/alan-grayson-tea-party-kkk-98673.html</ref>

===Political positions===
;Federal reserve
During his first term in office, Grayson supported [[Ron Paul]]'s [[Audit the Fed]] legislation.<ref name="Ocala Star-Banner"/> Grayson gained attention for exchanges with [[Federal Reserve System]] Vice Chairman [[Donald Kohn]] and [[Inspector General]] [[Elizabeth A. Coleman]].<ref name="salon"/> The 5-minute examination of Coleman in the House Financial Services Committee was posted on Grayson's official YouTube page, and as of December 2010, it has been viewed more than 4 million times.<ref name="Youtube"/>

On a September 2009 ''[[Alex Jones (radio host)|Alex Jones Show]]'' segment, Grayson criticized [[Chairman of the Federal Reserve|Federal Reserve Chair]] [[Ben Bernanke|Bernanke]]'s senior adviser Linda Robertson, saying "Here I am the only member of Congress who actually worked as an economist, this lobbyist, this [[K Street (Washington, D.C.)#Lobbying|K-Street]] whore, is trying to teach me about economics!"<ref name="problem child"/><ref name="salon war room"/> Robertson had previously worked as a lobbyist for [[Enron]].<ref name="Evans" /> Grayson's language was widely criticized as inappropriate,<ref name="politico.com"/> and Grayson apologized.<ref name="Evans"/>

Following the [[AIG bonus payments controversy]], Grayson joined fellow freshman Democrat [[Jim Himes]] of [[Connecticut]] to introduce the Grayson-Himes Pay for Performance Act, legislation to require that all bonuses paid by companies that had received funds under the [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008]] be "based on performance".<ref name="house passes1"/> The bill was co-sponsored by eight other members of the House. On March 26, the bill was approved by the House Financial Services Committee by a vote of 38–22 and on April 1, the bill was passed by the full House of Representatives by a vote of 247–171.<ref name="orlandosentinel"/>

Grayson was a co-sponsor of the [[Federal Reserve Transparency Act of 2009]], which would provide additional provisions to audit the [[Federal Reserve]], including removing several key exemptions.<ref name="transparency act"/>

;Economic stimulus
Grayson made it a priority to increase the amount of federal money returning to his district. He often said that people in his district had been "exporting taxes and importing debt." During his first year in office, the amount of federal grant dollars returning to the district nearly doubled with a 98% increase.<ref name="USAspending.gov"/><ref name="open congress"/> Grayson established a grant notification system that notifies subscribers immediately when a federal grant opportunity in their areas of interest becomes available. He also hired a full-time grants coordinator who focused solely on helping people navigate the federal grants process.

Grayson supported the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]] and has been outspoken in favor of extending unemployment benefits for Americans who have lost their jobs. Grayson argues that the government has never cut off unemployment insurance when the unemployment rate was higher than eight percent. Grayson also voted for [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] oversight of tobacco products, which would give the FDA power to regulate [[tobacco products|tobacco]].

Grayson has worked to combat federal waste, fraud, and abuse. In the September 6, 2009 edition of ''The New York Times'', columnist Gretchen Morgenson thanked Grayson for uncovering the fact that, due to the federal bailout of mortgage finance giant [[Fannie Mae]], taxpayer money had been funding the legal defense fees for former top executives at the institution. Grayson requested information about these legal costs after a June 2009 hearing of the House Financial Services Committee. Grayson's work uncovered that, between September 6, 2008 and July 21, 2009, taxpayers spent $6.3 million defending Fannie Mae executives Franklin Raines, J. Timothy Howard, and Leanne Spencer. Taxpayers paid an additional $16.8 million to cover legal expenses of workers at the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, Fannie's former regulator.<ref name=" The New York Times"/>

In September 2009, Grayson used a parliamentary maneuver called an "extension of remarks" to provide crucial instruction on H.R. 3221, the Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2009, a bill that, among other things, included a provision that prohibited funding for ACORN (the [[Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now]]). Grayson's extension of remarks directed that the legislation defund ''any'' organization that cheats the federal government, not just ACORN. The defunding measure passed the House with a final vote of 253–171.<ref name="Thomas.gov3221"/> Grayson also encouraged the public to report companies covered by the bill and set up a method to report offending companies via his Congressional website.<ref name=" The Huffington Post"/>

;Healthcare reform
In response to Republican arguments that the Obama administration's preferred health care bill was too long and complicated, Grayson on March 9, 2010, introduced H.R. 4789, the [[Public Option Act]] (sometimes called the Medicare You Can Buy Into Act), a short four-page bill which would allow all citizens and permanent residents of the United States to buy into the public [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] program at cost.<ref name="po act"/> The bill attracted 82 co-sponsors and was referred to the Ways and Means Committee.

Grayson later voted for the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]]<ref name="roll call 167"/> and the [[Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010]].<ref name="roll call 194"/> He voted in support of eliminating adjustments of Medicare rates of payment.  He also voted against Republican substitutes for the health care amendment and insurance law amendments.<ref name="key vote"/>

On September 29, 2009 in a late-night speech on the House floor, Grayson presented his impression of the Republican's heath plan, illustrated by signs. He said the Republican health plan was "don't get sick", and "if you do get sick, die quickly".<ref>http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0909/27726.html</ref> After demands from Republicans that he apologize, he defended his comment and in a [[Procedures of the United States House of Representatives#House floor|House Floor]] speech stated, “I apologize to the dead and their families that we haven't voted sooner to end this [[holocaust]] in America."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/09/30/house.floor.controversy/ | work=CNN | title=Democrat stands ground after 'die quickly' health care remark | date=October 1, 2009}}</ref> He was then further lambasted for his use of the word ''holocaust'' by Jewish spokespersons across the nation. Grayson, who is Jewish, apologized to the [[Anti-defamation League]] for those offended by his generic use of ''holocaust''.<ref name="young turks"/><ref name="unlikely"/><ref name="ref112"/> He also maintained that Congressional Republicans failed to offer a feasible plan.<ref name=cnnpoliticalticker/><ref name=cbsnews/> In October 2009 he launched [http://www.namesofthedead.com/ www.NamesOfTheDead.com], a website to "memorialize Americans who die because they don't have health insurance." He subsequently read stories of the dead submitted through the Names of the Dead site on the House floor.<ref name=namesofthedead/>

;Social issues
Grayson is [[United States pro-choice movement|pro-choice]] and supports increased funding for stem cell research.<ref>[http://www.ontheissues.org/FL/Alan_Grayson_Abortion.htm "Alan Grayson on Abortion"], ''On the Issues'', September 5, 2013</ref> He has always supported [[same-sex marriage]] and said in an interviews in 2013, "the propaganda that somehow gay marriage makes straight marriage bad for everyone is just farcical to me. I just don’t understand the logic of it."<ref>[http://www.watermarkonline.com/2013/07/18/rep-alan-grayson-discusses-the-future-of-lgbt-equality-and-why-he-returned-to-congress/ "Rep. Alan Grayson discusses the future of LGBT equality and why he returned to Congress"], ''WatermarkOnline'', July 18, 2013</ref>

Grayson voted in support of the Hate Crimes Expansion Act, which expands the definition of [[hate crimes]] and strengthens enforcement of [[Hate crime laws in the United States|hate crime laws]]. He also voted for the [[Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act]]. Grayson supported the [[Paycheck Fairness Act]], a bill that allows victims of [[wage discrimination]] to sue for punitive damages.<ref name="key vote"/>

;Environment
Grayson voted for the House's 2009 [[American Clean Energy and Security Act]] (ACES). The bill would provide for a $50 million "Hurricane Research Center" in Central Florida, and Grayson claimed it would immediately generate new jobs.<ref name="hurricane center"/> Grayson noted after the passage of the ACES Act his concern about our dependence on foreign oil, the need to promote [[green technologies]], [[renewable energy]] sources, and the job creation from the bill (an estimated 95,000 jobs in Florida). "This bill unleashes American ingenuity to solve the energy crisis. It lets us solve our problems by being Americans and thinking our way out of it. We will become an international energy power," he said in a news release.

The [[BP oil spill]] in the Gulf of Mexico affected Florida's number one industry, which is tourism. The lack of a relief well prevented company officials from shutting down the leak immediately. Instead, it took months to drill a new relief well, while millions of gallons of oil gushed into the Gulf each week.<ref name="The Daily Green"/> In response, Grayson introduced the Emergency Relief Well Act, which would require that an emergency relief well be drilled at the same time as any new exploratory well.

;Foreign affairs
Grayson has been an outspoken critic of the wars in [[Iraq War|Iraq]] and [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]]. In May 2010, he introduced the [[War Is Making You Poor Act]]. The bill would require the president to fund the wars from the Department of Defense's base budget. The bill does not necessitate an end to the wars or mandate a cut-off date. In addition to the tax cuts, the bill would cut the federal deficit by $15.9 billion.<ref name="open congress1"/>

Grayson has tried to combat wasteful spending by government defense contractors by introducing his "Gold Plating Amendment". The amendment would require that cost or price account for half of the evaluation of bids for defense contracts. The law at the time allowed for cost to account for only 1% of the evaluation. The amendment passed as part of the National Defense Authorization Act in June 2009. However, the language was stripped from the final bill during the conference committee between Senate and House leaders. Grayson worked successfully to get the amendment inserted into H.R.5013, the IMPROVE Acquisition Act, which passed the U.S. House of Representatives on April 28, 2010.<ref name="Thomas.gov5013"/>

Grayson has been an outspoken opponent of plans for the United States to intervene in the [[Syrian civil war]].<ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/05/alan-grayson-syria_n_3873867.html "Alan Grayson Criticizes Syrian Intervention: U.S. Shouldn't Police The Globe (VIDEO)"], ''The Huffington Post'', September 5, 2013</ref> He has rejected what he calls "warmongering",<ref>[http://www.democracynow.org/2013/9/5/rep_alan_grayson_on_syria_congress "Rep. Alan Grayson on Syria: Congress Should Reject "Warmongering" and Focus on Problems at Home"], ''DemocracyNow.org'', September 5, 2013</ref> saying: "It's simply not our responsibility. We're not the world's policeman." Instead, he called for a focus on humanitarian efforts and solving domestic problems.<ref>[http://www.orlandosentinel.com/entertainment/blogs/tv-guy/os-alan-grayson-syria-is-not-our-responsibility-20130903,0,5543222.post "Alan Grayson: Syria is not our responsibility"], ''Orlando Sentinel'', September 3, 2013</ref> He launched [http://dontattacksyria.com/ www.DontAttackSyria.com], where he began gathering signatures for his petition calling on Congress to vote against authorizing military action against Syria, and has been "whipping votes" in the House of Representatives.<ref>[http://www.slate.com/blogs/weigel/2013/09/05/alan_grayson_s_whipping_the_vote_against_striking_syria_because_we_re_not.html "Alan Grayson's Whipping the Vote Against Striking Syria Because "We're Not a Dictatorship""], ''Slate'', September 3, 2013</ref>
