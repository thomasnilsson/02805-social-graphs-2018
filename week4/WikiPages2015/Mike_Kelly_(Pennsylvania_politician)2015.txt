On August 1, 2012, Rep. Kelly held a [[press conference]] to mark the effective date of the controversial HHS mandate, which is the subject of more than 20 lawsuits and which has been decried by religious freedom advocates as a violation of the [[First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution|First Amendment]] of the [[U.S. Constitution]]. In his remarks, he said the mandate was an attack on Americans' constitutionally protected religious rights and that August 1, 2012, would go down in infamy as "the day that religious freedom died".<ref>http://cnsnews.com/news/article/congressman-were-still-home-brave-were-not-land-free-anymore</ref>
