Stutzman was elected in a November 2, 2010 special election to fill the rest of resigning Representative [[Mark Souder]]'s term. He was simultaneously elected to a full two year term to expire in 2013.

==Political positions==
Stutzman consistently received 90% ratings or above from the Chamber of Commerce and other small business associations for his support of pro-business legislation.  In 2008 he won the Small Business Champion Award <ref>{{cite web|author=InsideINdianaBusiness.com Report |url=http://www.insideindianabusiness.com/newsitem.asp?id=27433 |title=Indy Firm Named Chamber's Small Business of the Year - Newsroom - Inside INdiana Business with Gerry Dick |publisher=Insideindianabusiness.com |date=2008-01-22 |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref> from the Indiana Chamber of Commerce. He was cited as a Taxpayer Friendly State Legislators by Indiana WatchDog <ref>[http://finplaneducation.net/rating_stutzman_marlin.htm ]{{dead link|date=October 2013}}</ref> an independent, volunteer organization.

He served as the ranking member of the [[Indiana State Senate]] Utilities and Technology Committee and helped to pass alternative energy incentive legislation in Indiana.

In 2006 he served as the chairman of the Indiana Public Policy Committee taking strong stands for conservative values on controversial issues.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

===Federal Government Shutdown of 2013===
Stutzman supported the [[United States federal government shutdown of 2013|shutdown of the U.S. government in 2013]] but said he did not know what would be gained from it, saying, “We’re not going to be disrespected. We have to get something out of this. And I don’t know what that even is.”<ref>{{cite article|author=David M. Drucker |url=http://washingtonexaminer.com/gop-stands-firm-against-funding-bill-will-link-to-debt-ceiling-fight/article/2536750 |title=GOP stands firm against funding bill, will link to debt ceiling fight |publisher=Washington Examiner |date=2013-10-03 |accessdate=2013-10-03}}</ref>

===Government waste===
Stutzman advocates for more accountability in state government operations.  He co-authored a bill to establish the Hoosier Grace Commission which passed in 2003.  The commission helped eliminate wasteful state government spending and has brought fraud and/or scandals to public awareness.<ref>{{cite web|author=Posted on May 15th, 2008 at 10:48 pm by Jim |url=http://hoosieraccess.com/blog/2008/05/15/marlin-stutzman-declares-for-senate-district-13-caucus-to-replace-senator-meeks/ |title=Blog Archive » Marlin Stutzman Declares for Senate District 13 Caucus to Replace Senator Meeks |publisher=HoosierAccess |date=2008-05-15 |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref>

===Education===
Stutzman authored a bill that required more money to go directly to the classroom.  The bill was instrumental in paying back the $600 million that was owed by state government to schools, and increased funding for students six years in a row.

===Affordable Health Care Act===
In Congress, Stutzman has opposed the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]]. In September 2013, he advocated attaching a measure defunding the Act to must-pass legislation funding the federal government.<ref>'This is the line in the sand,' House Republicans say, by Lisa Mascaro, LA Times, 18 September 2013 </ref>

After the government subsequently shut down, Stutzman remarked that the issue at stake was no longer merely the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], and Republicans would need some concession in order to reopen the government.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hayward |first=Steven F. |url=http://washingtonexaminer.com/gop-stands-firm-against-funding-bill-will-link-to-debt-ceiling-fight/article/2536750 |title=GOP stands firm against funding bill, will link to debt ceiling fight |publisher=WashingtonExaminer.com |date=2013-10-03 |accessdate=2013-10-09}}</ref>

===Taxes===
In 2010 Stutzman signed a pledge sponsored by [[Americans for Prosperity]] promising to vote against any Global Warming legislation that would raise taxes.<ref>http://americansforprosperity.org/files/Stutzman_Marlin.pdf</ref>

==Controversies==

===Ethics allegation===
On June 6, 2010 a Facebook message from former [[Mark Souder|Rep. Mark Souder]] was sent to [[Noble County, Indiana|Noble County]] prosecutor Steven Clouse and GOP county chairman Randy Kirkpatrick regarding Stutzman's campaign finance "problem", Souder's affair with staffer Tracy Jackson, and predictions on the Republican's caucus to replace Souder on the November ballot.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fortwaynepolitics.com/2010/06/the-actual-souder-facebook-message/ |title=The actual Souder Facebook message |publisher=Fort Wayne Politics |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref> The fourteen-point message was eventually forwarded on to Republican leaders, journalist, and media outlets. Souder confirmed the authenticity of the message to ''[[The Journal Gazette]]'' by email, but he declined to comment beyond saying it was intended to be a private message.<ref name="journalgazette1">{{cite web|author=Benjamin Lanka and Niki Kelly |url=http://www.journalgazette.net/article/20100609/LOCAL/306099934 |title=GOP insiders shrug at Souder's missive &#124; The Journal Gazette &#124; Fort Wayne, IN |publisher=The Journal Gazette |date=2010-06-09 |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref>

In the Facebook message, Souder touts Stutzman as the favorite in the caucus but also asserts that Stutzman possibly played a role in making Souder’s affair public. Tracy Jackson's husband, Brad, is mentioned throughout the message as having flown Stutzman, while he was a United States Senate candidate, to numerous campaign stops throughout the state without reporting it to the [[Federal Election Commission|FEC]].

Stutzman's only response to date regarding the unreported flights by Brad Jackson was, "He (Souder) should be focusing on his family and his marriage right now. If he had concerns about our finances – which he shouldn’t – why didn’t he talk to me?”<ref name="journalgazette1"/>

==Political campaigns==

===2010 U.S. Senate campaign===
{{Main|United States Senate election in Indiana, 2010}}

Stutzman won decisively on the second ballot.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indianasnewscenter.com/news/local/96222209.html=June 12, 2010 |title= Stutzman Dominates Congressional Caucus| accessdate=March 1, 2011}}{{dead link|date=October 2013}}</ref> He defeated the Democratic candidate in both the general election and the special election to fill the remainder of Souder's term (both held on the same day).
