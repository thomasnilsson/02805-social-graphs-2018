'''Adrian M. Smith''' (born December 19, 1970) is the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|NE|3}}, serving since 2007. He is a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. He previously served in the [[Nebraska Legislature]].

==Early life, education, and early career==
Smith was born in [[Scottsbluff, Nebraska]] and at a young age his family moved to a rural neighborhood south of [[Gering, Nebraska]].  After graduating from [[Gering High School]] in 1989, Smith attended [[Liberty University]] in [[Lynchburg, Virginia]]. He transferred to the [[University of Nebraska-Lincoln]] midway through his second year of college, graduating in 1993.<ref>{{cite web | title=Biographical Directory of United States Congress | work=SMITH, Adrian | url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=s001172| accessdate=August 1, 2007 }}</ref> While a student at Nebraska, he interned in the Nebraska Governor’s Office and, later, served as a legislative page in the [[Nebraska Unicameral]]. He returned home to Gering after college, and, in 1994, he began serving as a member of the Gering City Council.  Smith continues to live in [[Gering, Nebraska]].

Smith has also worked in the private sector. He has been a realtor as well as a marketing specialist for the housing industry.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Elections===

;2006
Smith ran for the open seat in the 3rd District in the [[United States House elections, 2006|2006 House elections]].  Three-term incumbent [[Tom Osborne]] gave up the seat to make an unsuccessful run for [[governor of Nebraska|governor]].

Smith won the Republican [[Primary election|primary]] with 39% of the vote in a field of five candidates. He faced [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Scott Kleeb]], a ranch hand and Yale graduate, in the [[general election]].

Approximately one-third of the funding of his campaign came from members of the [[Club for Growth]], a fiscally conservative group that supports tax cuts, [[limited government]], school choice, and advocates eliminating all agricultural subsidies and the elimination of the [[US Department of Agriculture]].<ref>{{cite news

For a time, Smith was presumed to be a prohibitive favorite in this overwhelmingly Republican district. The 3rd is one of the most Republican districts in the nation; presidential and statewide candidates routinely win it with 70 percent or more of the vote.  The 3rd is extremely difficult to campaign in and has few unifying influences.  It covers nearly {{convert|65000|sqmi|km2}}, two time zones, and 68.5 of Nebraska’s 93 counties (one of which, [[Cherry County, Nebraska|Cherry County]], is larger than the entire state of [[Connecticut]]).  However, Kleeb raised more money than any other Democrat had raised in the district in decades.  Overall, the race was the most expensive in the district since it assumed its current configuration in 1963.

As the race become more competitive than expected, it received late national attention from the House [[Hill committee|campaign committees]].

President [[George W. Bush]] also made an appearance in the district two days before the election to campaign for Smith—a sign that the national party was very concerned about its chances in what had long been presumed to be a very safe Republican seat.

In the end, Smith won by 10 percentage points, taking 55 percent of the vote to Kleeb's 45 percent.

This was the closest a Democrat had come to winning the district in 16 years; in 1990, Republican [[Bill Barrett]] only defeated fellow Unicameral member Sandra Scofield by 4,400 votes.  Besides Bush's visit two days before the election, Smith likely [[coattail effect|rode the coattails]] of [[Governor of Nebraska|Governor]] [[Dave Heineman]], who won many of the counties in the district with 80 percent or more of the vote in his bid for a full term.
