'''William James "Bill" Pascrell, Jr.'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legistorm.com/person/bio/51559/William_James_Pascrell_Jr_.html |title=Representative William James Pascrell (Bill) (D-New Jersey, 9th) |publisher=LegiStorm |date= |accessdate=2013-10-04}}</ref> (born January 25, 1937) is the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|NJ|9}}.  He represented {{ushr|NJ|8}} from January 1997, until the redistricting of January 2013, and he is a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. The district includes Pascrell's hometown of [[Paterson, New Jersey|Paterson]] and includes parts of [[Bergen County, New Jersey|Bergen]] and [[Hudson County, New Jersey|Hudson]] Counties.

==Early life, education, and academic career==
The grandson of [[Italian people|Italian]] immigrants, Pascrell was born in [[Paterson, New Jersey]], the son of Roffie J. (née Loffredo) and William James Pascrell.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~battle/reps/pascrell.htm |title=Pascrell |publisher=Rootsweb.ancestry.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-04}}</ref> He attended St. George’s Elementary School, and in 1955, graduated from St. John the Baptist High School, where he was elected student council president. Pascrell went on to attend [[Fordham University]] in [[New York]] and subsequently earned a [[Bachelor’s degree|Bachelors]] in [[journalism]] and a [[Master’s degree|Masters]] in [[philosophy]].

Pascrell spent 12 years as a high school teacher in [[Paramus, New Jersey]], during which he taught several courses including [[psychology]], before being hired as a professor at [[Fairleigh Dickinson University]].  Previously, Pascrell was appointed to the Paterson Board of Education, where he served as president of the Board. He also served on the Board of Trustees of [[Passaic County Community College]].

==Early political career==

===State Assembly===
Pascrell was elected to the [[New Jersey General Assembly]] in 1987, eventually rising to the position of Minority Leader Pro Tempore.<ref>[http://www.pascrell.house.gov/display2.cfm?id=630&type=News "Rep. Bill Pascrell's Website"]{{dead link|date=June 2012}}</ref>  He won his seat in 1987 with 34% of the vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=395029 |title=NJ General Assembly 35 Race |publisher=Our Campaigns |date=Nov 3, 1987 |accessdate=2012-06-09}}</ref> He won re-election in 1989 (36%),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=214948 |title=NJ General Assembly 35 Race |publisher=Our Campaigns |date=Nov 7, 1989 |accessdate=2012-06-09}}</ref> 1991 (29%),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=40321 |title=NJ General Assembly 35 Race |publisher=Our Campaigns |date=Nov 5, 1991 |accessdate=2012-06-09}}</ref> 1993 (31%),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=149569 |title=NJ General Assembly 35 Race |publisher=Our Campaigns |date=Nov 2, 1993 |accessdate=2012-06-09}}</ref> and 1995 (33%).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=156653 |title=NJ General Assembly 35 Race |publisher=Our Campaigns |date=Nov 7, 1995 |accessdate=2012-06-09}}</ref> He served alongside [[John Girgenti]] for his first two.terms and [[Alfred E. Steele]] for the remaining four.

===Mayor of Paterson===
In May 1990, Pascrell was one of four candidates in Paterson's mayoral election with the winner to take the office that [[Frank Xavier Graves, Jr.|Frank Graves]], who had served since 1982, had vacated upon his death two months before the election. Pascrell won with 51% of the vote in the nonpartisan election<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=554609 |title=Paterson, NJ Mayor Race |publisher=Our Campaigns |date=May 8, 1990 |accessdate=2012-06-09}}</ref> and was re-elected in 1994 with 46% of the vote against his eventual successor [[Martin G. Barnes|Martin Barnes]], a Republican from the Third Ward, and former Mayor Thomas C. Rooney, Jr., a Democrat from the Sixth Ward.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=554608 |title=Paterson, NJ Mayor Race |publisher=Our Campaigns |date=May 10, 1994 |accessdate=2012-06-09}}</ref>

Pascrell served as mayor of Paterson while he also served as an assemblyman. For years this was a common practice for New Jersey officeholders, but new laws have rescinded the practice. {{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
In 1996, Pascrell ran for [[New Jersey's 8th congressional district]] and defeated [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] incumbent [[William J. Martini|Bill Martini]] 51%-48%, a margin of 6,249 votes. Pascrell was likely helped by [[Bill Clinton]]'s easy victory in New Jersey in that year's presidential election.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=27187 |title=NJ District 8 Race |publisher=Our Campaigns |date=Nov 5, 1996 |accessdate=2012-06-09}}</ref> After that, he never won re-election with less than 62% of the vote.

;2012
{{Main|United States House of Representatives elections in New Jersey, 2012}}
After redistricting, Pascrell's home was placed in the newly redrawn [[New Jersey's 9th congressional district]]. Fellow Democrat U.S. Congressman [[Steve Rothman]] decided to move into the 9th and challenge Pascrell in the primary. Rothman was placed in a Republican-leaning district against Republican [[Scott Garrett]].<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://blog.nj.com/njv_editorial_page/2011/12/us_rep_steve_rothmans_challeng.html |title=U.S. Rep Steve Rothman's challenge to Bill Pascrell is bad for N.J., U.S. |publisher=The Star-Ledger |date=December 30, 2011 |accessdate=2012-06-09}}</ref> Rothman represented 53% of the new 9th, while 43% of the new 9th district is from Pascrell's old 8th CD.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailyrecord.com/article/CN/20111228/NJNEWS/312280015/Dems-square-off-stay-Congress?odyssey=mod_sectionstories |title=Rothman to challenge Pascrell in 9th District Democratic battle |publisher=Daily Record |date= 2011-12-28 |accessdate=2013-09-10}}</ref>

Pascrell defeated Rothman in the Democratic primary on June 5, 31,435 to 19,947, capturing approximately 61.1% of the vote.<ref>{{cite web | title = Candidates for House of Representatives For PRIMARY ELECTION 06/05/2012 | work = Official election results | publisher = NJ Secretary of State | date = 2012-07-23 | url = http://www.njelections.org/2012-results/2012-official-primary-results-house-of-rep-0723.pdf | accessdate = 2013-09-10 }}</ref>

====2012 Election controversy====
Rothman's candidacy in the 2012 primary race reportedly devolved into a highly competitive proxy war over Israel, between the state’s pro-Israel community and a growing constituency of Arab voters who have accused a sitting congressman of putting Israel’s interests before America’s. Aref Assaf, president of the New Jersey-based American Arab Forum, published a column in the ''Newark Star Ledger'' titled, “Rothman is Israel’s Man in District 9” in which he wrote:

<blockquote>“As total and blind support becomes the only reason for choosing Rothman, voters who do not view the elections in this prism will need to take notice. Loyalty to a foreign flag is not loyalty to America’s [flag].”<ref name=Assaf/></blockquote>

Arabic-language campaign posters produced by Pascrell supporters reportedly encouraged the “Arab diaspora community” to elect Pascrell, “the friend of the Arabs.” The poster touted the race as “the most important election in the history of the [Arab American] community.”<ref name=Assaf>Assaf, Aref. [http://blog.nj.com/dr_aref_assaf/2012/02/rothman_is_israels_man_in_district_9_pascrell_is_the_peoples_choice.html Rothman is Israel's man in District 9], ''Newark Star Ledger'', February 19, 2012.</ref><ref>Glick, Caroline B. [http://www.jpost.com/LandedPages/PrintArticle.aspx?id=273110 Defeating the Jewish Alinskyites], ''Jerusalem Post'', June 7, 2012.</ref><ref name=freebeacon/>

Susan Rosenbluth, publisher of the New Jersey-based ''Jewish Voice and Opinion'' wrote that "a number of Arab-American constituents have come out with outrageous attacks on Rothman," and commented that "I haven’t heard a [[dual loyalty]] charge for years.” She also sharply criticized Pascrell for remaining silent and refusing to condemn the charges of dual loyalty.<ref name=freebeacon>Kredo, Adam.

===Tenure===
Pascrell is the first New Jerseyan to serve on the [[United States House Committee on Ways and Means|House Committee on Ways and Means]] in 10 years.

On October 10, 2002, Pascrell was among the 81 Democratic House members who voted in favor of authorizing the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]].<ref name="House of Representatives Roll call">{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/107-2002/h455 |title=107th Congress-2nd Session 455th Roll Call Vote of by members of the House of Representatives |publisher=Govtrack.us |date= |accessdate=2013-10-04}}</ref>

Pascrell was one of the original members of the [[U.S. House Committee on Homeland Security|Homeland Security Committee]], eventually rising to the post of [[ranking member]] on the Emergency Preparedness Subcommittee.  He has a particular interest in fire safety, and authored the bill that created the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program, which gives federal grants directly to all fire departments, including volunteer fire departments, which he calls "the forgotten part of the public safety equation".

He was also a member of the House Transportation Committee, where he worked to modernize roads, bridges, airports and mass transit systems. He has secured funding for reconstructing various dangerous roads and bridges throughout New Jersey, including bringing attention to the [[U.S. Route 46|Route 46]] corridor. In addition, he has helped craft legislation to renew federal surface transportation programs, providing funding toward New Jersey Transit. The new legislation tackled projects of rail expansion between Passaic and Bergen counties, bridge construction throughout Route 46, and the establishment of a bike-pedestrian path in [[South Orange, New Jersey|South Orange]].

Pascrell is an [[Italian American]] and has been outspoken about the representation of Italian-Americans in the media regarding what he sees as negative stereotypes in shows such as [[Home Box Office|HBO]]'s ''[[The Sopranos]]''. His Italian heritage was questioned by comedian [[Stephen Colbert]] of ''[[The Colbert Report]]'', who alleged in an interview that Pascrell could not truly be of Italian descent because Italian surnames must end with a vowel. Pressed by Colbert for an example of an Italian surname ending in a consonant, Pascrell responded with "Sole".<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/26/weekinreview/26stol.html?ex=1298610000&en=511364b1ab18854b&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss "Laugh, and the Voters Will Laugh With You, or at Least at You"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', February 26, 2006</ref>

During [[Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band]]'s 2009 [[Working on a Dream Tour]], Pascrell asked for investigations by the [[Federal Trade Commission]] and the [[U.S. Department of Justice]] into the practices of [[Ticketmaster]] and [[TicketsNow]] in regard to sales of tickets to the tour's New Jersey shows.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/music/ny-nyspring0204,0,4567075.story | title=Springsteen ticket glitch has pol calling for federal probe | agency=[[Associated Press]] | publisher=''[[Newsday]]'' | date=2009-02-03 | accessdate=2009-02-07| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090214062843/http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/music/ny-nyspring0204,0,4567075.story| archivedate= 14 February 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Pascrell subsequently introduced proposed federal legislation, titled the "BOSS ACT" (Better Oversight of Secondary Sales and Accountability in Concert Ticketing), which would require primary ticket sellers to disclose how many tickets were being held back from sale, prohibit ticket brokers from buying tickets during the first 48 hours on sale, and prohibit primary ticket sellers, promoters, and artists from entering the secondary market.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.nj.com/news/ledger/jersey/index.ssf?/base/news-13/124382912174260.xml&coll=1 | title=The BOSS ACT rewrites rules on ticket sales | author=McGlone, Peggy | publisher=''[[The Star-Ledger]]'' | date=2009-06-01 | accessdate=2009-06-21| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090611192246/http://www.nj.com/news/ledger/jersey/index.ssf?/base/news-13/124382912174260.xml&coll=1| archivedate= 11 June 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> In 2012, problems again arose during the first ticket sales for Springsteen's 2012 [[Wrecking Ball Tour]]. Ticketmaster said web traffic was 2.5 times its highest level for the year. Shows were selling out within minutes and many tickets at much higher prices appeared on resale websites such as [[StubHub]] less than an hour after the onsale time. Pascrell again responded saying he would reintroduce the BOSS ACT bill to Congress.<ref>{{cite web|last=Fixmer |first=Andy |url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-01-29/ticketmaster-says-scalpers-system-as-springsteen-goes-on-sale.html |title=Ticketmaster Says Scalpers System as Springsteen Goes on Sale |publisher=Businessweek |date=January 27, 2012 |accessdate=2012-06-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Feldman |first=Emily |url=http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/NY-Jersey-Rep-Bill-Pascrell-Slams-Ticketmaster-Following--138219294.html |title=N.J.

After the death of a young boy in his district who returned to playing football without having fully recovered from a concussion sustained earlier in the season in October 2008, Pascrell introduced the Concussion Treatment and Care Tools Act (the ConTACT Act), which has received the endorsements of the [[National Football League]], the [[National Football League Players Association]], and the Brain Injury Association of America. The legislation brings together a conference of experts to produce a consensus set of guidelines for the treatment and care of concussions for middle and high school students. It also provides funding for schools' adoption of baseline and post-injury [[neuropsychology|neuropsychological]] testing technologies.<ref>{{cite news|title=Congressman Pascrell Testifies Before House Judiciary Committee Hearing on Head Injuries Related to Participation in Sports|url=http://www.house.gov/apps/list/press/nj08_pascrell/pr10282009.shtml|newspaper=Congressman Bill Pascrell|date=October 28, 2009}}</ref>

In January 2011, Congressman Pascrell responded to the Tucson shooting of Congresswoman [[Gabrielle Giffords]] by stating, "[t]here's an aura of hate and elected politicians feed it, certain people on Fox News feed it."<ref>{{cite news|last=Jackson|first=Herb|title=NJ lawmakers shocked by shooting of Congresswoman Giffords, others at public event|url=http://www.northjersey.com/news/010811_NJ_lawmakers_shocked_by_by_shooting_of_Congresswoman_Giffords.html?page=all|newspaper=The Record|date=January 9, 2011}}</ref>

On March 12, 2013, Pascrell introduced the [[Traumatic Brain Injury Reauthorization Act of 2013 (H.R. 1098; 113th Congress)]], a bill that would [[authorization bill|reauthorize]] [[appropriations bill (United States)|appropriations]] for [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) projects to reduce the incidence of [[traumatic brain injury]] and projects related to track and monitor traumatic brain injuries.<ref name=1098sum>{{cite web|title=H.R. 1098 - Summary|url=https://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/1098|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=24 June 2014}}</ref> He is the Co-founder and Co-chair of the Congressional Brain Injury Task Force, which was founded in 2001 and now includes more than a hundred members of Congress.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pascrell.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/pascrell-tbi-reauthorization-headed-to-president-s-desk |title=Pascrell TBI Reauthorization Headed to President’s Desk |publisher=pascrell.house.gov |date=2014-11-14 |accessdate=2014-11-14}}</ref>
