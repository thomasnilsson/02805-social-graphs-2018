'''James Patrick "Jim" McGovern''' (born November 20, 1959) is a member of the [[United States House of Representatives]], representing {{ushr|MA|2}}. He is a member of the [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]].

Born and raised in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], McGovern attended [[Worcester Academy]]. While in college he worked as a congressional aide to [[United States Senator|U.S. Senator]] [[George McGovern]] (to whom he has no relation), a two-time presidential candidate for whom he campaigned. From 1981 to 1996 he was a senior staff member for U.S. Representative [[Joe Moakley]]. McGovern first ran for Congress in 1994, where he lost in the Democratic primary. He ran again in 1996, defeating Republican incumbent [[Peter Blute]]. He has since been re-elected.

A focus of his career has been international human rights, which he has advocated for in countries such as [[El Salvador]], [[Sudan]], and [[Colombia]]. He is a member of the [[Congressional Progressive Caucus]]<ref>{{cite web | url=http://cpc.grijalva.house.gov/index.cfm?ContentID=166&amp;ParentID=0&SectionID=4&SectionTree=4&lnk=b&ItemID=164 | title=Congressional Progressive Caucus | publisher=Cpc.grijalva.house.gov | date=June 2, 2010 | accessdate=August 23, 2010 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100804085247/http://cpc.grijalva.house.gov/index.cfm?ContentID=166&amp;amp;ParentID=0&amp;SectionID=4&amp;SectionTree=4&amp;lnk=b&amp;ItemID=164 <!--Added by H3llBot--> | archivedate=August 4, 2010}}</ref> and has been ranked as one of the most liberal members of Congress.<ref name="nationaljournal" />

==Early life==
James Patrick McGovern<ref>{{cite web | last=McGovern | first= Jim | date=December 6, 1998 | url=http://query.nictusa.com/cgi-bin/fecimg/?_98034102066+0 | title=Statement of Candidacy | publisher= [[Federal Election Commission]] | accessdate=July 9, 2010}}</ref> was born in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]] on November 20, 1959. He grew up in Worcester, where his mother Mindy was a dance instructor and his father Walter owned a liquor store.<ref name="mccarthy">{{cite news |last=McCarthy |first=Colman |date=November 19, 1996 |title=This time, an upset for McGovern |work=The Washington Post |page=D20}}</ref><ref name="cq-2007" /> In junior high school, he first became involved in politics by campaigning for Democratic [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[George McGovern]] (to whom he is not related) in his unsuccessful [[George McGovern presidential campaign, 1972|1972 presidential bid]]. After graduating from [[Worcester Academy]] he moved to Washington, D.C., where from 1977 to 1980, he worked as an aide to George McGovern. He attended [[American University]], where he received a Bachelor of Arts in history in 1981 and a [[Masters of Public Administration]] in 1984. George McGovern ran for president again in 1984, Jim McGovern was the state coordinator of his Massachusetts campaign branch, and he made his nominating speech at the [[1984 Democratic National Convention]].<ref name="cq-2007">{{Harvnb|Koszczuk|Angle|2007}}.</ref>

In 1981 McGovern joined the Capitol Hill staff of [[Joe Moakley]], a Democratic [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] from Massachusetts.<ref name="cq-2007"/> He was appointed by Moakley in 1990 to lead a House task force investigating the 1989 murder of six Jesuit priests and two women in [[El Salvador]] by the [[Atlacatl Battalion|Salvadoran Army]]. He later advocated cutting off U.S. funding for the [[Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation|U.S. Army School of the Americas]], where several of the military members had been trained.<ref name="cq-2007"/>

==Congressional record==

=== Electoral history ===
McGovern first ran for Congress in 1994, running in a crowded Democratic primary to represent the area then defined as Massachusetts's 3rd District.<ref name="cq-2007"/> The district, located in central and southeastern Massachusetts, included the city of Worcester and parts of [[Bristol County, Massachusetts|Bristol]], [[Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Middlesex]], [[Norfolk County, Massachusetts|Norfolk]], and [[Worcester County, Massachusetts|Worcester]] counties.<ref>[http://nationalatlas.gov/printable/congress.html#ma National Atlas]</ref> During the campaign McGovern asserted that his record as "a Washington insider" would make him a more effective representative. Despite endorsements from George McGovern, Joe Moakley, and presidential aide [[George Stephanopoulos]], McGovern lost in the primary to [[Massachusetts House of Representatives|Massachusetts State Representative]] [[Kevin O'Sullivan (politician)|Kevin O'Sullivan]].<ref name="cq-2007"/><ref>{{cite news | last=Connolly | first=Timothy J | date=September 8, 1994 | title=McGovern runs as Washington insider | work=[[Telegram & Gazette]] }}</ref>

McGovern left Moakley's office in 1996 and moved back to Worcester, again running for Congress. Unopposed in the Democratic primary, he ran against Republican incumbent [[Peter Blute]] in the general election. His campaign slogan focused on unseating House Speaker [[Newt Gingrich]]: "To dump Newt you have to dump Blute."<ref>{{cite news | last=Oliphant | first=Thomas | date=December 17, 1995 | url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/access/21424248.html?FMT=ABS | title=Aiming at Newt through Blute | publisher=[[The Boston Globe]] | page=A23 | accessdate=September 30, 2010}}</ref> Blute was endorsed by ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' and five other local papers, but McGovern won the election with 53 percent of the vote.<ref name="mccarthy"/><ref name="elections"/> He has never faced another contest nearly that close, and has been re-elected seven times.  He ran unopposed in 2000 and 2002.<ref name="elections"/>

The National Journal reported that McGovern has been able to use his Capitol Hill experience to help position himself as "a power broker in the Democratic caucus." In 2001, the dying Moakley asked [[Dick Gephardt]] to help McGovern attain a seat on Rules, which schedules much of the legislation for the House floor. He didn't receive that next seat, but was given a commitment for the next available Democratic seat. While on Rules, McGovern was able to use his experience with House procedures to his advantage. With Republicans comprising the majority of the panel, he "showed a sharp partisan edge as he embraced parliamentary maneuvers that led to cries of outrage" from House GOP members. McGovern is currently in position to take over the top Democratic position on Rules when [[Louise Slaughter]] retires.<ref name="McGovern Almanac Biography">{{cite web|title=Rep. Jim McGovern (D)|url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/almanac/2010/person/jim-mcgovern-ma/|work=NJ Almanac|publisher=National Journal}}</ref>

In 2004, he was opposed by Republican [[Ronald A. Crews]], an evangelical pastor, former [[Georgia House of Representatives|Georgia state legislator]], and president of the [[Massachusetts Family Institute]]. Crews, a national [[conservatism in the United States|conservative]] activist, challenged McGovern's positions on [[same-sex marriage in the United States|same-sex marriage]] and [[abortion in the United States|abortion]]. McGovern derided his opponent's focus on social issues, saying, "When Ron Crews gets up in the morning, the first thing he thinks about is gay marriage. … I don't think that is the most important issue for most families. Jobs, health care, education, how to make the world a more peaceful place, those are the issues people care about."<ref>{{cite news | last=Vennochi | first=John | date=May 20, 2004 | url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2004/05/20/mcgovern_faces_fight_over_values/ | title=McGovern faces fight over 'values' | work=The Boston Globe | page=A19 | accessdate=September 25, 2010}}</ref> McGovern defeated Crews with 71 percent of the vote, and ran unopposed in 2006 and 2008.<ref name="elections"/>

In the 2010, he faced Republican [[Marty Lamb]], a real estate lawyer, and independent Patrick J. Barron, a Department of Mental Health administrator.<ref>{{cite news | first=Priyanka | last=Dayal | date=September 15, 2010 | url=http://www.telegram.com/article/20100915/NEWS/100919794/0/news06 | title=Lamb takes GOP: Winner faces McGovern in November | work=[[Telegram & Gazette]] | location=[[Worcester, Massachusetts]] | accessdate=September 26, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | first=Priyanka | last=Dayal | date=September 1, 2010 | url=http://www.telegram.com/article/20100901/NEWS/9010364/1101/NEWSREWIND | title=Barron qualifies for Nov. 2 ballot: 'Low-budget campaign' planned | work=[[Telegram & Gazette]] | location=Worcester, Massachusetts | accessdate=September 26, 2010 }}</ref> He was re-elected with 57 percent of the vote.<ref name="results-2010"/>

====Transportation====
For his first three terms, McGovern served on the [[United States House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure|House Transportation Committee]]. He and fellow Massachusetts representative [[John Olver]], who served on the [[United States House Committee on Appropriations|House Appropriations Committee]], would coordinate to bring extensive transportation funding to their respective districts. When criticized for his heavy use of [[earmark (politics)|earmarks]], McGovern was quoted in response saying, "It's not [[pork barrel|pork]]. It's nourishment."<ref>{{cite news | last=Hohler | first=Bob |author2=Globe Staff | date=November 19, 1999 | url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/access/46482323.html?FMT=ABS | title=Hard-dealing congressmen reap $760M for Bay State | work=The Boston Globe | page=A1 | accessdate=September 25, 2010}}</ref>

====Fiscal policy====
McGovern supported economic stimulus efforts during the [[late-2000s recession]], including the [[Economic Stimulus Act of 2008|Economic Stimulus Act]] in February 2008<ref>{{USBill|110|H.R.|5140}}</ref> and the [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008|Emergency Economic Stabilization Act]] (which established the [[Troubled Asset Relief Program]]) in October 2008.<ref>{{USBill|110|H.R.|1424}}</ref> He supported the [[Obama administration]]'s [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009|2009 stimulus package]].<ref>{{USBill|111|H.R.|1}}</ref> Responding to Republican criticism of Democratic budgetary priorities, he chided the GOP for running up the [[United States public debt|national debt]] under [[George W. Bush]], saying: "It is somewhat ironic that the very people who drove this economy into a ditch are now complaining about the size of the tow truck."<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/washington/articles/2009/02/25/house_passes_410_billion_spending_bill | title=House OKs $410B bill to boost domestic programs | first=David | last=Espo | date=February 25, 2009 | work=[[KPFA]] Evening News }}</ref> He voted to instate the [[Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act]] in February 2010.<ref>{{USBill|111|H.J.Res|45}}</ref>

====Education====
The [[Higher Education Act of 1998]] included an amendment by McGovern that doubled [[Pell Grant]] funding for two years for students who graduate in the top 10 percent of their class.<ref>{{cite news | last=Black | first=Chris | date=September 30, 1998 | url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/access/34672885.html?FMT=ABS | title=Senate backs college aid bill: Hurdle cleared for rise in student grants, loans | page=A3 | work=The Boston Globe | accessdate=September 25, 2010}}</ref>

====Nutrition====

As co-chair of the [[United States House of Representatives Hunger Caucus|House Hunger Caucus]], McGovern is an advocate for expanding child nutrition programs both domestically and internationally.<ref>{{cite news | first=Stephanie | last=Vallejo | date=June 10, 2010 | url=http://www.boston.com/news/politics/politicalintelligence/2010/06/mcgovern_rachel.html | title=McGovern, Rachael Ray push for child nutrition programs | work=The Boston Globe | accessdate=September 26, 2010}}</ref> In 2007 McGovern obtained $840 million in required funding for the [[McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program]] in the House version of the [[farm bill]].<ref>{{cite news | first=Dan | last=Morgan | date=July 27, 2007 | title=House rejects Farm Bill | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/27/AR2007072700397.html | work=The Washington Post | accessdate=September 26, 2010}}</ref> The [[United States congressional conference committee|House–Senate conference committee]] stripped most of the funding from the final bill.<ref>{{cite news | first=Dan | last=Morgan | date=May 6, 2008 | title=Farm Bill negotiators cut funds for overseas school lunch program | work=The Washington Post | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/05/05/AR2008050502282.html | accessdate=September 26, 2010}}</ref>

As the co-chairman of the [[Congressional Hunger Center]], McGovern has pushed for changes to foreign aid and hunger relief programs. He proposed establishing a "hunger czar position" to take on food issues. McGovern also took part in the [[Food stamp challenge]], which entailed living on the average $21 in food stamps over the course of a week.<ref name="McGovern Who Runs Gov">{{cite news | title=James P.

====Immigration====
McGovern has voted against major efforts to restrict [[illegal immigration to the United States|illegal immigration]], including the [[REAL ID Act of 2005]],<ref>{{USBill|109|HR|418}}, incorporated into {{USBill|109|HR|1268}}</ref> the [[Border Protection, Anti-terrorism, and Illegal Immigration Control Act of 2005]],<ref>{{USBill|109|HR|4437}}</ref> and the [[Secure Fence Act of 2006]].<ref>{{USBill|109|HR|6061}}</ref>

====Health care====
McGovern believes health care is a human right. He voted for the [[Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010]], ultimately pushing for a robust public option which wasn't included in the final measure.<ref name="McGovern Who Runs Gov"/>

====Corporate personhood====
In 2010, McGovern said that he thought the [[Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission|Supreme Court's ''Citizen's United'' case]] was wrongly decided, and that money does not equal free speech. He elaborated, saying that corporations should not "have the same equality as a regular voter." At first he said that "the Constitution was wrong," but he later said that he had misspoken. On November 15, 2011 McGovern introduced the [[People's Rights Amendment]], a proposal to limit the Constitution's protections to only the rights of natural persons, and not corporations.<ref>{{USBill|112|HJR|88}}</ref> In January 2012, McGovern promoted his participation in a panel discussion entitled "Corporations are not people."<ref name="Corporations are not people">{{cite web | last=McGovern | first=Jim | title=Corporations are not people: A special panel with Sen. Eldridge, John Bonifaz, and Jeff Clements | url=http://bluemassgroup.com/2012/01/corporations-are-not-people-a-special-panel-with-sen-eldridge-john-bonifaz-and-jeff-clements-this-monday/ | publisher=BlueMassGroup | accessdate=June 21, 2012}}</ref> 
On July 14th 2014 McGovern introduced [https://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-joint-resolution/119/text H.J. Res 119] with Representative [[Ted Deutch]], which includes a section to address corporate personhood, as quoted here, "Congress and the States shall have power to implement and enforce this article by appropriate legislation, and may  distinguish between natural persons and corporations or other  artificial entities created by law, including by prohibiting such entities from spending money to influence elections."

====Social issues====
McGovern has a [[pro-choice]] record on [[abortion in the United States|abortion]]. He voted against the [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act]] in October 2003<ref>{{USBill|108|S|3}}</ref> and the [[Unborn Victims of Violence Act]] in February 2004.<ref>{{USBill|108|HR|1997}}</ref> He supports [[stem cell laws and policy in the United States|stem cell research]], having voted in favor of the [[Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act]] in 2005, 2007, and 2009.<ref>{{USBill|109|HR|810}}, {{USBill|110|HR|3}}, and {{USBill|111|HR|873}}</ref> He voted for the [[Employment Non-Discrimination Act of 2007]], which would have prevented employment discrimination on the basis of [[sexual orientation]].<ref>{{USBill|110|HR|3685}}</ref> He voted against the [[Federal Marriage Amendment]], which would have constitutionally outlawed [[same-sex marriage in the United States|same-sex marriage]], in 2004 and 2006,<ref>{{USBill|108|HJRes|106}}, {{USBill|109|HJRes|88}}</ref> and co-sponsored the [[Respect for Marriage Act of 2009]], which would allow the federal government to recognize same-sex marriages.<ref>{{USBill|111|HR|3567}}</ref>

===Foreign policy===
McGovern has vocally opposed the [[Iraq War]] since its inception.<ref name="cq-2007"/> He voted against the [[Iraq Resolution|initial authorization]] of military force against Iraq in October 2002.<ref>{{USBill|110|H.J.RES.|114}}</ref> In May 2007, McGovern introduced {{USBill|110|H.R.|2237}}, to "provide for the redeployment of United States Armed Forces and defense contractors from Iraq." The bill failed with a vote of 255 to 171.

He initially supported the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|War in Afghanistan]], but has become increasingly skeptical of the war. In June 2010 he pushed a funding amendment which would require President [[Barack Obama]] to provide for a draw-down plan before any further funding would be authorized. "Let us not waste, you know, more resources, more lives, on a policy that quite frankly is going to lead us nowhere," said McGovern. "We need to let [[President of Afghanistan|Afghan President]] [[Hamid Karzai]] know that we're not a cheap date. … We expect him to clean up his government."<ref>{{cite episode | transcripturl=http://archives.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1007/01/sitroom.01.html | series=[[The Situation Room]] | airdate=July 1, 2010 | network=[[CNN]] | title=Russian Spy Confesses; President Obama Speaks on Immigration Reform; Hurricane Alex Complicates Gulf Oil Cleanup }}</ref>

McGovern has been a prominent voice against the Islamist governments of [[Sudan]] for its prosecution of the [[war in Darfur]]. He has been arrested twice during protests outside the Sudanese Embassy in Washington D.C. On April 28, 2006, he was one of five members of Congress arrested while protesting atrocities in the [[Darfur]] region.<ref>{{cite news | first=Jim | last=Doyle | url=http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/04/28/MNG4RIH93T7.DTL | title=Five members of Congress arrested over Sudan protest | work=San Francisco Chronicle | date=April 28, 2006 | accessdate=September 25, 2006}}</ref> Also arrested were U.S. Representatives [[Sheila Jackson Lee]] (D-Texas), [[Jim Moran]] (D-Virginia), Rep. [[John Olver]] (D-Massachusetts), and [[Tom Lantos]] (D-California). McGovern was arrested again at the Sudanese embassy on April 27, 2009, this time accompanied by Reps [[John Lewis (U.S. politician)|John Lewis]] (D-Georgia), [[Donna Edwards]] (D-Maryland), [[Lynn Woolsey]] (D-California), and [[Keith Ellison (politician)|Keith Ellison]] (D-Minnesota).<ref>{{cite news | first=Foon | last=Rhee | url=http://www.boston.com/news/politics/politicalintelligence/2009/04/mcgovern_other.html | title=McGovern, other lawmakers arrested at Darfur protest | work=Boston Globe | date=April 27, 2009 | accessdate=February 23, 2010}}</ref> He was arrested again on March 16, 2012 alongside [[George Clooney]] during a protest outside of the Sudanese embassy speaking out against the Bashir regime in the Sundan.<ref>{{cite web|last=Corcoran|first=Lindsay|title=McGovern Arrested During Protest in D.C.|url=http://westborough.dailyvoice.com/news/mcgovern-arrested-during-protest-dc|publisher=The Westborough Daily Voice|accessdate=July 19, 2012}}</ref>

In April 2007, he called for the United States and other countries to boycott the [[2008 Olympic Games]] in [[Beijing, China]] to protest the Chinese government's support of the Sudanese government and, by extension, the [[genocide]] in [[Darfur]].<ref>{{cite web | last=Melady | first=Mark | url=http://www.telegram.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070414/NEWS/704140340/1005/NEWS06 | title=McGovern suggests boycott of Olympics | work=[[Telegram & Gazette]] | date=April 14, 2007 | accessdate=April 14, 2007}}</ref>

McGovern has traveled several times to [[Colombia]] to meet with human rights advocates, and has been very critical of [[Plan Colombia]] and US military aid to that country. On March 25, 2008, the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' published an unsigned editorial suggesting that McGovern supported the [[Marxist]] [[Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia|FARC]] rebels in [[Colombia]]. According to the Journal, an investigation of the computer hard drive of the recently killed [[Raúl Reyes]], second-in-command of the FARC, had turned up material indicating “an ardent effort” on the part of McGovern “to do business directly with the FARC.” The article said that McGovern had been “working with an American go-between, who has been offering the rebels help in undermining Colombia's elected and popular government.”<ref>{{cite news | url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120640555842961083.html?mod=opinion_main_review_and_outlooks | title=Review & Outlook: A FARC Fan's Notes | work=Wall Street Journal | date=March 25, 2008 | accessdate=June 23, 2008}}</ref> In response to these charges, McGovern said that his concern was to help win the release of hostages held by the FARC, as requested by several families of Americans held by the FARC.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.telegram.com/article/20080326/NEWS/803260394/1052/NEWSREWIND | title=McGovern angry over claim he backs Colombian rebels | work=[[Telegram & Gazette]] | date=March 26, 2008 | accessdate=February 23, 2010}}</ref> He said that he had no sympathy for the rebels or for their hostage-taking.

On February 13, 2009, McGovern offered a resolution on the subject of the trial of the Iranian [[Bahá'í]] leadership co-sponsored by seven others in {{USBill|111|H. RES.|175}} – "Condemning the Government of Iran for its state-sponsored persecution of its Baha'i minority and its continued violation of the International Covenants on Human Rights" which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Affairs.<ref>{{cite press release | title =Condemning the Government of Iran for its state-sponsored persecution of its Baha'i minority and its continued violation of the International Covenants on Human Rights.

McGovern has aligned himself with liberal and [[progressivism in the United States|progressive]] causes. "It's no secret that I'm a liberal," he said in 2010. "I didn't poll any of this stuff, but I am who I am."<ref>{{cite news |last=Slack |first=Donovan |date=August 28, 2010 |url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2010/08/28/running_hard_against_the_scott_brown_effect/?page=full |title=Running hard against the Scott Brown effect |work=The Boston Globe |accessdate=September 25, 2010 }}</ref> Political interest groups generally rank McGovern as one of the most liberal members of Congress.

From 1997 to 2007, the liberal advocacy group [[Americans for Democratic Action]] gave him an average vote rating of 98.5 percent, whereas its [[conservatism in the United States|conservative]] counterpart, the [[American Conservative Union]], gave him an average vote rating of 2.5 percent.<ref>Data assembled from {{Harvnb|Koszczuk|Angle|2007}} and previous editions.</ref> The [[United States Chamber of Commerce]], which advocates for business-oriented policies, has given McGovern a 33 percent lifetime rating as of 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uschamber.com/issues/legislators/how-they-voted-2011-house |title=How They Voted 2011 – House |publisher=[[United States Chamber of Commerce]] |accessdate=February 2, 2013}}</ref>
