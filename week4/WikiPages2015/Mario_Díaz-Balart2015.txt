'''Mario Rafael Díaz-Balart Caballero''' (born September 25, 1961) is a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] from [[Florida]].  He has represented a district in the [[Miami]] area since 2003, currently numbered as the [[Florida's 25th congressional district|25th district]].  His current district includes much of southwestern [[Miami-Dade County]], including the city of [[Hialeah]], as well as much of the northern portion of the Everglades.

==Early life, education, and early political career==
Díaz-Balart was born in [[Fort Lauderdale]] in 1961 to the late [[Cuba]]n politician [[Rafael Díaz-Balart]]. His aunt, [[Mirta Díaz-Balart]], was the first wife of [[Fidel Castro]].  Her son, and his cousin, is Fidel Ángel "Fidelito" Castro Díaz-Balart. His uncle is the Cuban-Spanish painter, [[Waldo Díaz-Balart]]. His brother, [[Lincoln Díaz-Balart]], represented Florida's 21st District from 1993 to 2011. He has two other brothers, [[José Díaz-Balart]], a journalist, and Rafael Díaz-Balart, a banker.

He attended the [[University of South Florida]] to study [[political science]] before beginning his public service career as an aide to then-[[Miami]] Mayor [[Xavier Suárez]] in 1985. In the same year, he changed his political party affiliation from [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] to Republican.<ref>El Nuevo Herald, Díaz-Balart Se Pasa Al Partido Republicano, April 24, 1985</ref>

==Florida legislature==
He was elected to the [[Florida House of Representatives|Florida House]] in 1988 and moved to the [[Florida Senate]] in 1992. He returned to the Florida House in 2000. During his second tenure in the House, he chaired the redistricting committee.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
;2002-2006
Díaz-Balart gave up his seat in the state house to run in the newly created 25th District, which included most of western [[Miami-Dade County]], part of [[Collier County]] and the mainland portion of [[Monroe County, Florida|Monroe County]].  It was widely believed that he had drawn this district for himself, given that he was chairman of the state house redistricting committee.  He easily won the seat with 64 percent of the vote.  He was unopposed for reelection in 2004, and won a third term with 58 percent of the vote in 2006.

;2008
{{Main|United States House of Representatives elections in Florida, 2008#District 25}}
In 2008, however, Díaz-Balart faced his strongest challenge to date in [[Joe García]], former Executive Director of the Cuban American National Foundation and former chairman of the Miami-Dade County Democratic Party.  Despite the perception that Díaz-Balart had drawn the district for himself, it was actually fairly marginal on paper, with a [[Cook Partisan Voting Index]] of R+4.  Ultimately, Díaz-Balart defeated Garcia with 53 percent of the vote.

;2010
{{Main|United States House of Representatives elections in Florida, 2010#District 21}}
On February 11, 2010, Díaz-Balart announced his intention to seek election in [[Florida's 21st congressional district]]—being vacated by his brother, Rep. [[Lincoln Díaz-Balart]]—rather than the 25th district.<ref name="rollcall1">{{cite web|url=http://www.rollcall.com/news/43199-1.html?type=printer_friendly |title=Mario Díaz-Balart Will Run to Succeed His Brother |publisher=Roll Call |date=2010-02-11 |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref>  Unlike the 25th, the 21st has long been considered the most Republican district in the Miami area.

No other party even put up a candidate when filing closed on April 30, handing the seat to Mario Diaz-Balart.<ref>[http://election.dos.state.fl.us/candidate/CanList.asp Official State of Florida Division of Elections Website]</ref>

;2012
{{Main|United States House of Representatives elections in Florida, 2012#District 25}}
Díaz-Balart was reelected unopposed in 2012 in the renumbered 25th district.  Indeed, since this district's creation in 1993 (it was numbered as the 21st from 1993 to 2013), the Republican candidate has run unopposed in all but two elections.

===Tenure===
Mario Díaz-Balart's voting record is moderate to conservative.  For his first two terms in Congress, Díaz-Balart was a member of the conservative [[Republican Study Committee]].

He is a founding member of the [[Congressional Hispanic Conference]], a caucus of Hispanic Republican congressmen. Like his Cuban-American colleagues in both the Senate and the House of Representatives, Díaz-Balart is a strong advocate of maintaining the [[Cuban embargo]], saying "Some people do not understand the embargo of Cuba. Its purpose is to keep American [[hard currency]] out of the hands of a Communist thug by restricting most trade and travel."<ref>[http://www.house.gov/mariodiaz-balart/news/columns/071104_nydailynewscuba.htm ]{{dead link|date=August 2010}}</ref>

On September 29, 2008, Díaz-Balart voted against the [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008]]<ref>{{cite web|title=FINAL VOTE RESULTS FOR ROLL CALL 681|url=http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2008/roll681.xml|work=FINAL VOTE RESULTS FOR ROLL CALL 681|publisher=US House of Representatives}}</ref>
