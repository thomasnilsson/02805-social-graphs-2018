She is a member of the [[Congressional Progressive Caucus]].  She frequently gains ratings of between 90 and 100 from liberal and progressive interest groups and lower ratings from conservative groups.

In April 2009 Schakowsky pointedly criticized the tax day [[Tea Party protests]], asserting that they were "an effort to mislead the public about the Obama economic plan that cut taxes for 95 percent of Americans and creates 3.5 million jobs." Schakowsky added, "It's despicable that right-wing Republicans would attempt to cheapen a significant, honorable moment of American history with a shameful political stunt."<ref>[http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/lawmaker-news/36720-schakowsky-tea-parties-despicable/ "Schakowsky: Tea parties 'despicable'"], by Eric Zimmerman, ''The Hill,'' April 16, 2009.</ref>

In Feb 2013, Schakowsky indicated her support for banning assault weapons as only a beginning step towards more gun control measures including a ban on handguns.<ref>{{cite web|last=Mattera|first=Jason|title=Democrat Congresswoman: Assault Weapons Ban 'Just the Beginning'|url=http://www.ijreview.com/2013/03/41206-congresswoman-says-assault-weapons-ban-just-the-beginning/|publisher=Independent Journal Review|accessdate=16 November 2013}}</ref>

In response to concerns about electoral irregularities in the state of [[Ohio]] during the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential election]], Schakowsky was one of 31 members of the [[United States House of Representatives]] who voted not to accept Ohio's [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral vote]]s.<ref>http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2005/roll007.xml</ref>
