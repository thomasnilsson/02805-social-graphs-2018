He first won election to Congress during a special election in April 2010 in Florida's 19th district. He previously served in the [[Florida Senate]]. In 2012, due to redistricting, he ran for and won re-election in [[Florida's 21st congressional district|Florida's 21st district]].<ref name="election.dos.state.fl.us">[http://election.dos.state.fl.us/candidate/CanDetail.asp?account=55253 Candidate Tracking system - Florida Division of Elections - Department of State<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

== Early life, education, and law career ==

Deutch was born in [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania]], the son of Jean (née Mindlin) and the late Bernard Deutch, who earned a [[Purple Heart]] during World War II. His grandparents were Jewish immigrants from [[Lithuania]] and [[Belarus]].<ref>[http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/%7Ebattle/reps/deutch.htm Ted Deutch ancestry<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Deutch graduated from the [[University of Michigan]], where he served as Editor-in-Chief of ''Consider'' magazine, and the [[University of Michigan Law School]]. He received the [[Harry S. Truman Scholarship]] in 1986 while attending the [[University of Michigan]].

Before running for Congress, Deutch worked as a commercial development attorney with the Florida law firm of Broad and Cassel.

==Florida Senate==
In 2009, Deutch authored the "Protecting Florida’s Health Act", a public health initiative with the goal of reducing [[youth smoking]] through an increased surcharge on tobacco products. The legislation funded up to $1 billion health care programs in Florida, including $50 million per year in dedicated cancer research funding. The legislation earned him national recognition as winner of the National Distinguished Advocacy Award given by the [[American Cancer Society]].

In the Senate, Deutch has also passed legislation which attempted to improve health care for seniors, promote public education, and protect children and the environment. In addition, he helped to secure a new senior center in [[Palm Beach County]] and provided new services for [[Holocaust]] survivors.

As a member of the National Young Leadership Cabinet of United Jewish Communities, Deutch organized over 2,500 people to march on Capitol Hill in Washington, with the intent of pressuring Congress on a slate of issues affecting children and the elderly. At the end of his tenure in the Senate, Deutch was serving as Vice Chair of the Senate Committee on Regulated Industries and the Policy and Steering Committee on Ways and Means.<ref name="bio">{{cite web|url=http://www.tedforcongress.com/bio.asp|title=About Ted|publisher=Ted Deutch for Congress|accessdate=April 14, 2010}}</ref>

He won the Democratic primary with 85% of the vote, and on April 13, 2010, won the [[Florida's 19th congressional district special election, 2010|special election]], defeating Republican [[Edward J. Lynch]].<ref name="palmbeachpost.com">[http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/state/republican-concedes-deutch-keeps-wexlers-south-florida-congressional-561407.html?cxntcid=breaking_news Republican concedes; Deutch keeps Wexler's South Florida congressional district Democratic]</ref>

Deutch's district is located on the east coast of [[Florida]]. It includes parts of [[Palm Beach County|Palm Beach]] and [[Broward County|Broward]] counties, and the city of [[Coral Springs, Florida|Coral Springs]]. The district trends Democratic, giving 65% of its votes to President [[Barack Obama]] in 2008.

After Florida underwent redistricting in 2012, Deutch filed for re-election in Florida's 21st district.<ref name="election.dos.state.fl.us"/> Deutch easily won the November 6, 2012 [[general election]] with no major party opposition.<ref>{{cite web|last=Carney|first=Heather|title=Hastings, Deutch, Wasserman Schultz win re-election|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2012-11-06/news/fl-election-us-house-20-21-23-20121106_1_republican-karen-harrington-wasserman-schultz-democrat-alcee-hastings|work=sun-sentinel.com|accessdate=November 9, 2012}}</ref>

===Legislative Record===

Shortly after his election, Deutch introduced the Preserving our Promise to Seniors Act, which aims to keep Social Security benefits in line with retirees' costs and gradually lifts the cap on FICA taxes over a period of seven years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E04E4D71630F931A1575BC0A9669D8B63|title=FOR SOCIAL SECURITY, A BIRTHDAY MAKEOVER |publisher=New York Times|accessdate=September 26, 2012}}</ref>

During the 2011 debate over the debt ceiling, Deutch assembled and brought to the House floor an elaborate, game-show style to illustrate which government services he claimed would be endangered by a default on the U.S. national debt.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://videocafe.crooksandliars.com/david/rep-ted-deutch-spins-gop-wheel-misfortune-ho|title=Rep.

In 2011, Deutch was one of several cosponsors of the controversial [[Stop Online Piracy Act]] (SOPA), a bill that would permit copyright holders to effectively shut down websites that they believed to be directly or indirectly contributing to copyright infringement. To achieve this, the copyright holder would need to request and obtain a court order from the [[U.S. Department of Justice]] by making a statement of good-faith belief that the copyright was being violated. The Act was tabled following extensive online and offline protests.

;Constitutional Amendment

On November 19, 2011, Rep. Deutch introduced a resolution<ref name="amendment 1">{{cite web|url=http://deutch.house.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=269672|title=Rep.

Rep. Deutch’s amendment is a blend of "ideas from "Move to Amend, Free Speech for People, [[Public Citizen]], [[People For the American Way]], [[Common Cause]], and the [[Center for Media and Democracy]]".<ref name="amendment 2">{{cite web|url=http://www.nationofchange.org/finally-constitutional-amendment-99-1321798437|title=Finally, a Constitutional Amendment for the 99%|publisher=Nation of Change |accessdate=November 30, 2011}}</ref>

"Section 4.
