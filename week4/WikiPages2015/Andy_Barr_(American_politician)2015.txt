'''Garland Hale''' "'''Andy'''" '''Barr IV''' (born July 24, 1973) is an [[United States|American]] politician and lawyer who has served as the [[United States House of Representatives|United States Representative]] for [[Kentucky's 6th congressional district]] since 2013.

A native of [[Lexington, Kentucky]], Barr completed undergraduate studies at the [[University of Virginia]] in 1996. While in college, he worked as an intern for [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Mitch McConnell]] and the [[Republican National Committee]]. After graduation, he worked as a legislative assistant for then-[[Missouri]] Representative [[Jim Talent]] before enrolling at the [[University of Kentucky College of Law]]. He completed his law degree in 2001 and joined the Lexington firm of [[Stites & Harbison]]. After representing the running mate of Republican gubernatorial candidate [[Ernie Fletcher]] in a dispute over residency requirements in 2003, he joined Fletcher's transition team after his [[Kentucky gubernatorial election, 2003|election]] and eventually became part of his executive staff. He was not implicated in the hiring scandal that plagued Fletcher's administration, and in fact, claimed that he had warned administration officials of potential violations of the state [[merit system]].

Barr returned to private practice after [[Kentucky gubernatorial election, 2007|Fletcher was defeated for reelection]]. In 2009, he announced he would challenge [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Ben Chandler]] in the [[United States elections, 2010|2010 midterm elections]]. The [[National Republican Congressional Committee]] targeted the race as part of their strategy to gain a majority in the U.S. House of Representatives and provided considerable financial backing to Barr's campaign. Chandler won the election by fewer than 700 votes, and Barr finally conceded defeat after a recanvass failed to yield an appreciable difference in the margin. In mid-2011, however, he announced he would again [[United States elections, 2012|challenge Chandler in 2012]]. Again aided by campaign funds from the national party&nbsp;– which were countered by contributions to Chandler by the [[Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee]]&nbsp;– Barr won the election by over 11,000 votes.

==Early life and education==
Barr was born in Lexington, Kentucky, and is the son of Garland Hale Barr III and Rev. Donna R. (Faulconer) Barr.<ref name=mulls>Brammer, "GOP's Barr mulls run for Congress"</ref> The Barr family has been in Lexington for generations, and Barr Street in that city is reportedly named for one of Barr's ancestors.<ref name=fineline>Cheves, "Barr says he offers respite from 'career politicians'"</ref> His father founded the law firm of Barr, Anderson and Roberts and his mother is a deacon in the [[Episcopal Diocese of Lexington]].<ref name=mulls />

Barr graduated from [[Henry Clay High School]] in [[Lexington, Kentucky]], in 1992.<ref name=2009announce>Musgrave, "Former Fletcher aide running for Congress"</ref> He attended the [[University of Virginia]] where, as a contributor to a conservative campus publication called ''The Virginia Advocate'', he was highly critical of then-[[President of the United States|President]] [[Bill Clinton]] for allegedly [[Draft evasion|evading the draft]].<ref name=fineline /> While in college, he was also an intern for [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[Mitch McConnell]] and the [[Republican National Committee]].<ref name=fineline /> In 1993, he was arrested in [[Key West, Florida]], and charged with possessing a fake [[Mississippi]] [[driver's license]].<ref name=fineline /> He pled guilty to the charge and was sentenced to eight hours of community service.<ref name=fineline />

Barr graduated with a bachelor's degree in government and philosophy in 1996.<ref name=fineline /> From 1996 until 1998, he worked as a legislative assistant to [[Jim Talent]], then a [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] from [[Missouri]].<ref name=2009announce /> In 1999, he was charged with [[public intoxication]] in Lexington, a charge that was dismissed four months later.<ref name=fineline /> In 2001, Barr earned a law degree from the [[University of Kentucky College of Law]].

==Law career==
Commencing practice in Lexington, he joined the Fayette County Bar Association Young Lawyers Section and co-founded the Lexington Charity Club&nbsp;– a non-profit organization of young men raising money for charitable causes&nbsp;– with Lee Greer and Rob Lewis.<ref name=patrick>Patrick, "A Different Brown-Bag Meeting"</ref> In 2002, he joined the liability defense service group and the business litigation service group at the Lexington law firm of [[Stites & Harbison]].<ref name=sah>"Personnel File". ''Lexington Herald-Leader''</ref> While there, he worked for former [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[Attorney General of Kentucky|Kentucky Attorney General]] and future [[Governor of Kentucky|Governor]] [[Steve Beshear]], who urged him to get involved in state politics.<ref name=2009announce /> Barr and colleague Brad Cowgill were employed by Republican gubernatorial candidate [[Ernie Fletcher]] in 2003 to fight charges that Fletcher's running mate, [[Hunter Bates]], did not meet the state's residency requirements for eligibility for the office of [[Lieutenant Governor of Kentucky|lieutenant governor]].<ref name=fineline /> A judge ruled against Bates, and he was dropped from the ticket.<ref name=fineline />

===Fletcher administration===
[[File:Ernie Fletcher.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=A man with dark hair and glasses wearing a black jacket and tie and white shirt|Ernie Fletcher employed Barr during his gubernatorial administration.]]
After [[Kentucky gubernatorial election, 2003|Fletcher won the election]], Barr was named to the governor-elect's transition team in the Public Protection and Regulation Cabinet.<ref name=fletchertransition>"Fletcher Transition Team Members". ''The Kentucky Post''</ref> Ultimately, Fletcher chose Barr as general counsel for the governor's office of local development.<ref name=link>Alessi, "State Office Stopped Recruiting Candidates"</ref> When Fletcher declared April to be Child Abuse Prevention Month in Kentucky, Barr wrote Fletcher's speech for the occasion.<ref name=fineline /> While researching the speech, he made contact with the non-profit group Prevent Child Abuse in Kentucky.<ref name=fineline /> He became interested in the organization's mission and was elected to its board of directors in 2004; he served as vice-president of the organization in 2007 and president in 2008 and 2009.<ref name=fineline /><ref>Wingo, "Personnel File" (2004, 2007, June 2008, and 2009)</ref>

Fletcher's term in office was marred by a hiring scandal that involved violations of the state [[merit system]].<ref name=2009announce /> Barr was not implicated in the scandal; he told the ''[[Lexington Herald-Leader]]'' that Fletcher's Local Initiatives for a New Kentucky (LINK) outreach program&nbsp;– a sub-unit of the office of local development&nbsp;– stopped recruiting and vetting individuals for merit positions in the executive branch after he briefed officials about an opinion issued by the Executive Branch Ethics Commission during the administration of Fletcher's predecessor, [[Paul E. Patton]], regarding acceptable and unacceptable hiring under the merit system.<ref name=link /> The ''Herald-Leader'' later requested copies of any employment recommendations made by LINK employees, but Barr refused the request, citing an exemption in [[Freedom of information legislation (Kentucky)|Kentucky's Open Records Act]] that provides exemptions for "preliminary drafts, notes and correspondence" of state employees.<ref name=openrecords>Cheves, "Fletcher Disbands Outreach Agency, Keeps Its Activities Secret"</ref>

===Post-Fletcher administration===
In 2007, Fletcher's general counsel resigned to become executive director of the Kentucky Bar Association; deputy general counsel David E. Fleenor was elevated to general counsel, and Barr replaced Fletcher as deputy general counsel.<ref name=dgc>"N. Kentucky Police Chief is Charged with DUI". ''Lexington Herald-Leader''</ref> In this capacity, he authored a defense of Fletcher's executive order that the [[Ten Commandments]] be posted in the rotunda of the [[Kentucky State Capitol|state capitol]] alongside other historical documents.<ref name=fineline /> Fletcher was [[Kentucky gubernatorial election, 2007|defeated for reelection in 2007]] and before his term expired, he named Barr to the state Public Advocacy Commission.<ref name=pac>Alessi, "Fletcher rewards supporters Scores Appointed to State Boards, Commissions"</ref>

In April 2008, Barr returned to private practice as an associate at the law firm of Kinkead and Stilz; he also worked as a part-time instructor, teaching constitutional law at the University of Kentucky.<ref name=2009announce /><ref name=pf2008>Wingo, "Personnel File" (April 2008)</ref> He was chosen as an alternate delegate to the [[2008 Republican National Convention]] and served as vice-president of the Fayette County Republican Party.<ref name=2008altdelegate>Alessi, "GOP delegates upset two groups"</ref><ref name=2008vp>Brammer, "Lineup of candidates for fall is taking shape"</ref>

==Congressional campaigns==

===2010===
[[File:Benchandler.jpeg|thumb|left|upright|alt=A man with brown hair and glasses wearing a black jacket, gray shirt, and red patterned tie|Ben Chandler, Barr's opponent in 2010 and 2012]]
After forming an exploratory committee in September 2009, on November 10, 2009, Barr became the first Republican to formally announce that he would seek his party's nomination to challenge incumbent 5th district congressman Ben Chandler.<ref name=2009announce /> In the announcement, he touted his opposition to the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] (which Chandler had also opposed) and the [[American Clean Energy and Security Act]] (which Chandler supported).<ref name=2009announce /> Barr's campaign raised far more money than those of any of his five opponents in the Republican [[primary election|primary]].<ref name=2009nominated>Cheves, "Republicans pick Barr to challenge Chandler"</ref> Barr garnered 31,255 votes in the primary, while his opponents' totals ranged from 4,789 to 1,880.<ref name=2009primaryresults>"On the ballot". ''Lexington Herald-Leader''</ref>

In an interview with [[WKYT-TV]] in July, Barr further elaborated on his platform.<ref name=wkyt>Cheves, "Barr: Cut earmarks, federal spending"</ref> Declaring his support for the free market, he denounced the recently signed [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act|Dodd–Frank Act]] that enacted new regulations on the banking industry.<ref name=wkyt /> He called for an end to the practice of politicians [[Earmark (politics)|earmarking]] funds for special projects in their districts, a position that put him at odds with state party leaders like McConnell and long-time [[Kentucky's 5th congressional district|5th district]] Congressman [[Hal Rogers]].<ref name=wkyt /> Although he supported strengthening security along the [[Mexico–United States border|U.S. border with Mexico]] to curb illegal immigration, he stated his belief that fellow Republican Senate candidate [[Rand Paul]]'s plan to deny citizenship to U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants was a violation of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]].<ref name=wkyt />

The [[National Republican Congressional Committee]] targeted Barr's race against Chandler as part of their strategy to gain control of the House of Representatives during the [[United States elections, 2010|2010 midterm elections]], and [[Ohio]] Congressman [[John Boehner]]&nbsp;– who stood to become [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] if the Republicans gained a majority&nbsp;– visited the state to campaign on Barr's behalf.<ref name=chandlerwin>Cheves, "Chandler declares win as GOP takes House"</ref> Substantial amounts of money from political groups outside the state aided both candidates and spawned a number of negative campaign ads.<ref name=chandlerwin /> Chandler started the barrage in August with ads alluding to Barr's arrest in [[Florida]] for using a fake ID and seeking to tie him to the wrongdoing of the Fletcher administration.<ref name=chandlerwin /> Barr countered with ads criticizing Chandler's support of cap-and-trade legislation&nbsp;– an unpopular vote in coal-dependent Kentucky&nbsp;– and his vote in favor of the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]], which Barr characterized as a waste of taxpayer money that did little to stimulate an economic recovery.<ref name=chandlerwin />

Unofficial election day results showed Chandler scoring a narrow victory over Barr, but the race was so close that Barr refused to concede.<ref name=concede>Musgrave, "Barr concedes to Chandler"</ref> When the official results were released, Chandler had received 119,812 votes to 119,163 for Barr.<ref name=concede /> Barr petitioned [[Secretary of State of Kentucky|Kentucky Secretary of State]] [[Trey Grayson]] for a recanvass of the voting machines in the district, but this yielded only one additional vote for Barr.<ref name=concede /> On November 12, ten days after the election, Barr announced that he would concede the election to Chandler rather than requesting a full recount.<ref name=concede />

===2012===
On June 9, 2011, Barr announced that he would again challenge Chandler for his seat in the [[United States elections, 2012|2012 elections]].<ref name=2012announce>Brammer, "Barr to run for Congress again"</ref> The announcement was immediately hailed by [[Texas]] Congressman [[Pete Sessions]], chairman of the National Republican Campaign Committee, who said, "we need Republicans like Andy Barr to join us in Congress to cut spending, lower taxes and reduce the national debt."<ref name=2012announce /> Chandler responded to the announcement by declaring, "Next year, voters will have a very simple choice to make: whether to protect and save Social Security and Medicare, or to end them," an allusion to Barr's publicly expressed support for [[Wisconsin]] Congressman [[Paul Ryan]]'s [[The Path to Prosperity|budget proposal]].<ref name=2012announce />

In July 2012, [[Roll Call]] reported that "a wide swath of influential Republicans in Kentucky see Barr’s campaign as something of a lost cause...In the eyes of those who know Kentucky best, from Washington, D.C., to Frankfort, this isn’t much of a race right now."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://atr.rollcall.com/kentucky-barr-poll-shows-him-behind-by-5-points/|title=Kentucky: Andy Barr Poll Shows Him Behind by 5 Points|date=July 9, 2012|accessdate=August 13, 2014}}</ref>

[[File:Rand Paul 2011.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=A man with brown, wavy hair wearing a suit and holding a microphone|Rand Paul endorsed Barr in 2012 despite their differences on issues like the Patriot Act.]]
Barr easily turned back token opposition in the Republican primary and again received financial support from the National Republican Campaign Committee in his general election campaign.<ref name=2012primary>Brammer, "Barr wins easily, setting up rematch with Chandler"</ref> When Chandler decided not to attend the [[2012 Democratic National Convention]], Barr charged that he was trying to avoid association with President [[Barack Obama]], who was seeking a second term but who was unpopular with many voters in Kentucky.<ref name=2012dconvention>Brammer, "Chandler skipping his party's convention"</ref> A spokesperson for Chandler maintained that Chandler had previous engagements in his home district that week, but that he supported Obama's reelection.<ref name=2012dconvention /> Barr was chosen to give a brief address at the [[2012 Republican National Convention]], during which he decried Obama's perceived hostility toward the coal industry.<ref name=2012rconvention>Brammer, "Barr uses GOP appearance to assail coal policies"</ref> Chandler campaign staffers criticized Barr's decision to attend the convention, stating that he should spend the time in his district, getting to know the people there better.<ref name=2012invite>Brammer, "Barr to speak at GOP convention"</ref> They also mocked the fact that the backdrop for Barr's speech was a picture of the city of [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], which is not in the 6th district; Barr's campaign countered that they had no part in choosing the backdrop.<ref name=2012rconvention />

Both candidates began their TV ad campaigns with more positive ads; Barr's wife appeared in his first ad, touting him as a "family man", while Chandler tried to combat Barr's charges of fiscal liberalism by releasing an ad criticizing excessive government spending.<ref name=tvwar>Alford, "Chandler, Barr begin TV ad war in 6th District"</ref> [[Tea Party movement|Tea Party]]-backed Kentucky Senator [[Rand Paul]] endorsed Barr despite differences between the two on some policy matters, including Barr's support for the [[Patriot Act]].<ref name=tvwar /> The positive tone did not hold as the race tightened, however. Chandler's campaign attacked Barr for using a mining executive from [[Morganfield, Kentucky|Morganfield]]&nbsp;– which is well outside the 6th district&nbsp;– as a coal miner from [[Estill County, Kentucky|Estill County]]&nbsp;– which is in the district.<ref name=2012coal>Alford, "Coal exec threatens to sue Chandler"</ref> The campaign's charges that the man depicted was "not a miner" prompted him to threaten a suit for [[defamation]], and he produced copies of his certified miner credentials in rebuttal to the charge.<ref name=2012coal /> The [[Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee]] also bought ads that again raised the issue of Barr's previous conviction and his association with Fletcher.<ref name=2012fletcher>Brammer, "New ad signals race tightening"</ref>

Barr won the election by a vote of 153,222 to 141,436.<ref name=avenge>Brammer, "Republican Barr avenges 2010 loss to Chandler"</ref>

==U.S. House of Representatives==
Barr's two-year term began on January 3, 2013.

===Legislation===
Barr supported the [[Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2014 (H.R. 4005; 113th Congress)]], a bill that would amend laws that govern the activities of the [[United States Coast Guard]] (USCG), the [[United States Maritime Administration|Maritime Administration]] (MARAD) within the [[United States Department of Transportation|Department of Transportation]], and the [[Federal Maritime Commission]] (FMC).<ref name=4005cbo>{{cite web|title=H.R. 4005 - CBO|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/45168|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=1 April 2014}}</ref> Barr testified in favor of the bill because it would "remove the requirement that Valley View Ferry captains be licensed through the Coast Guard, and instead allow the state to implement its own licensing requirement."<ref name=RichmondRegister>{{cite news|last=Hogsed|first=Sarah|title=Valley View Ferry legislation moves out of committee|url=http://www.richmondregister.com/localnews/x1783689807/Valley-View-Ferry-legislation-moves-out-of-committee|accessdate=1 April 2014|newspaper=Richmond Register|date=26 February 2014}}</ref> At present, the local ferry has had to cut back on hours because the ferry has been unable to find a new captain for ferry due to the stringent Coast Guard requirements to get a merchant mariner license, despite the fact that the ferry only travels 500 feet on steel cables, without any steering capabilities.<ref name="RichmondRegister"/> If the bill were to pass, the state government would be able to lower the licensing requirement for such a small ferry with only limited capabilities.

On July 11, 2013, Barr introduced the [[CFPB Rural Designation Petition and Correction Act (H.R. 2672; 113th Congress)]], a bill that would amend the [[Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]] to direct the [[Consumer Financial Protection Bureau]] (CFPB) to establish an application process that would allow a person to get their county designated as "rural" for purposes of a federal consumer financial law.<ref name=2672sum>{{cite web|title=H.R. 2672 - Summary|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/2672|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=4 May 2014}}</ref> One practical effect of having a county designated "rural" is that people can qualify for some types of mortgages by getting them exempted from the CFPB's qualified mortgage rule.<ref name=HouseExIRS>{{cite news|last=Marcos|first=Cristina|title=The week ahead: House to hold ex-IRS official in contempt|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/scheduling/205099-the-week-ahead-house-to-hold-ex-irs-official-in-contempt|accessdate=5 May 2014|newspaper=The Hill|date=2 May 2014}}</ref><ref name=BankersWeb>{{cite web|title=Dodd-Frank Dispatch: "Rural Area" Designation Would Provide Consumer Financial Protection Laws Relief|url=http://www.bankersweb.com/headlines/article/rural-area-designation-consumer-financial-protection-laws-relief|publisher=BankersWEB.com|accessdate=5 May 2014|date=17 March 2014}}</ref>

On March 6, 2014, Barr introduced the [[Restoring Proven Financing for American Employers Act (H.R. 4167; 113th Congress)]], a bill that would "exempt existing [[collateralized loan obligation]]s from the so-called "[[Volcker Rule]]," which bars banks from making risky trades with their own money and limits their investments in certain funds."<ref name=Cheves1>{{cite news|last=Cheves|first=John|title=Democrats call on Andy Barr to return $42,808 he collected with indicted lawmaker|url=http://www.kentucky.com/2014/04/30/3220338/democrats-call-on-andy-barr-to.html|accessdate=1 May 2014|newspaper=Lexington Herald-Leader|date=30 April 2014}}</ref> The bill passed in the House on April 29, 2014 in a [[voice vote]].<ref name=4167allactions>{{cite web|title=H.R. 4167 - All Actions|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/4167/all-actions/|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=1 May 2014}}</ref>
