===Tenure===
Mica also lists himself as a strong supporter of military issues.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} The Orlando Sentinel named Mica the 4th most powerful person in Central Florida.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/local/orl-maxwell2808dec28,0,689864.column|title=Who is the most powerful person in Central Florida?|last=Maxwell|first=Scott |date=2008-12-29|publisher=Orlando Sentinel}}</ref>

Representative Mica’s political positions in areas such as abortion, gun control, health care, immigration, business and consumers, and National Security have stayed consistently conservative and are therefore rated very highly by interest groups that support Republicans. Some examples of these groups are the [[National Rifle Association]], the [[Federation for American Immigration Reform]], [[American Security Council Foundation]], and the [[National Right to Life Committee]], as well as many others. On the opposing side of these positions are some Democratic-leaning interest groups, who rate John Mica as very low in areas such as abortion, sexual orientation and gay marriage rights, civil liberties and civil rights, and protecting the environment. Some of the interest groups that have given these lower ratings are Planned Parenthood, NARAL Pro-Choice America, [[American Civil Liberties Union]], [[Environment America]], [[Human Rights Campaign]], and more.  Representative Mica's views have stayed consistent in these and many other areas. One example of an area in which he has changed his ratings is the support of Arts and Humanities.  His  [[Americans for the Arts Action Fund]] ratings increased from 20% and 65% from 2000 to 2008 and then to 100% in 2011.<ref name="Project Vote Smart">{{cite web|title=Representative John L. Mica's Special Interest Group Ratings|url=http://votesmart.org/candidate/evaluations/26805/john-mica#.UKsEa5bhfvc|publisher=Project Vote Smart}}</ref>

As chairman of the House Oversight Committee's subcommittee on government operations, Mica has convened hearings on marijuana in every month of 2014 except April, earning him the title of "one of the most obsessive drug warriors in Congress," by Marijuana Majority. <ref>{{cite web|last1=Itkowitz|first1=Colby|title=Rep.

;Abortion
Representative Mica’s view on abortion is pro-life “except in the case of rape, incest or life of the mother.” This position has gained him high ratings from Republican interest groups such as the [[National Right to Life Committee]], and very low ratings from Democratic ones such as [[Planned Parenthood]] and [[NARAL Pro-Choice America]].<ref name="Project Vote Smart"/><ref name="votesmart.org">{{cite web|title=Representative John L Mica's Political Positions|url=http://votesmart.org/candidate/political-courage-test/26805/john-mica/#.UKsEd5bhfvc|publisher=Project Vote Smart}}</ref>

;Budget
Mica believes that balancing the budget is, and should be, a priority of Congress. He however does not agree with the majority of his party that Medicare and Medicaid spending should be reduced.<ref name="votesmart.org"/>  The Conservative interest group ratings on Mica’s budget goals and position range from 86 to 90%, while the Liberal interest group ratings reward Mica with an average of 10%.<ref name="Project Vote Smart"/>
