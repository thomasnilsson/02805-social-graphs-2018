After his father's death, Payne declared his intention to run in two elections in 2012: the [[New Jersey's 10th congressional district special election, 2012|special election]] to fill the remainder of his father's unexpired term, and the regularly scheduled election for the two-year term beginning in January 2013. The primaries for both elections were held on June 5, 2012, and the general elections will be held on November 6, 2012.

According to documents filed on May 24, 2012 with the [[Federal Election Commission]], Payne both raised and spent more money than any of the other Democratic candidates.<ref name="newsday20120525">{{cite news |url=http://www.newsday.com/news/region-state/payne-jr-leading-dem-primary-fundraising-battle-1.3741498 |title=Payne Jr. leading Dem. primary fundraising battle |agency=The Associated Press |date=May 25, 2012 |work=[[Newsday]] |accessdate=May 26, 2012}}</ref> Payne was endorsed by House [[Minority Leader]] [[Nancy Pelosi]] on May 22, 2012.<ref name="star20120522">{{cite news |url=http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/05/nancy_pelosi_endorses_donald_p.html |title=Nancy Pelosi endorses Donald Payne Jr. to replace late father in N.J.'s 10th District
