She is a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. The district is based in [[Denver]].

==Early life, education and career==
A fourth-generation Coloradan, DeGette was born in [[Tachikawa, Tokyo|Tachikawa]], [[Japan]], the daughter of Patricia Anne (''née'' Rose) and Richard Louis DeGette.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~battle/reps/degette.htm |title=Degette |publisher=Ancestry.com |accessdate=2013-06-19}}</ref> Her parents were American, and, at the time of her birth, her father was serving in the armed forces. She graduated from [[Colorado College]] where she earned a [[B.A.]] in [[political science]], and was elected to the [[Pi Gamma Mu]] international honor society in 1979<ref>{{cite web|title=Diana DeGette's Biography|url=http://votesmart.org/candidate/biography/561/diana-degette#.VJnSwV4AOB|website=Project Vote Smart|accessdate=23 December 2014}}</ref>. She earned a [[Juris Doctor]] degree from [[New York University]] in 1982. She then returned to Denver and began a law practice focusing on [[civil rights]] and employment litigation.

==Colorado Legislature==
Long active in Denver politics, she was elected to the [[Colorado General Assembly|Colorado House of Representatives]] in 1992. She was reelected in 1994 and chosen as assistant minority leader. She authored a law that guarantees Colorado women unobstructed access to [[abortion]] clinics and other medical care facilities, also known as the "Bubble Bill". The [[United States Supreme Court]] found DeGette's "Bubble Bill" constitutional in ''Hill v. Colorado'', 530 U.S. 703 (2000).

===Committee assignments===
*'''[[United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce|Committee on Energy and Commerce]]'''
**[[United States House Energy Subcommittee on Communications and Technology|Subcommittee on Communications and Technology]]
**[[United States House Energy Subcommittee on Environment and Economy|Subcommittee on Environment and Economy]]
**[[United States House Energy Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations|Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations]] (Ranking Member)

===Party leadership===
*[[Chief Deputy Whips of the United States House of Representatives|Chief Deputy Whip]] (110th, 111th, 112th United States Congresses)

DeGette serves as the co-chair of both the Congressional [[Diabetes]] Caucus and [[Pro-Choice]] Caucus, and is Vice Chair of the [[LGBT Equality Caucus]]. With the Democrats' victory in the 2006 midterm elections, DeGette briefly considered running for [[House Majority Whip]], but bowed out in favor of [[Jim Clyburn]] of [[South Carolina]]. 

DeGette received national attention in 2005, when the House of Representatives passed legislation she cosponsored to lift President [[George W. Bush]]'s limits on federal funding for [[embryonic stem cell research]]. DeGette, who had been working on the measure since 2001, enlisted the support of Representative [[Michael N. Castle]] (Republican from Delaware), who became DeGette's principal Republican cosponsor of the legislation. The [[Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2005|DeGette-Castle bill]] passed the Senate on July 18, 2006. President Bush vetoed the bill the next day — [[List of United States presidential vetoes|his first veto]].

In 2007, DeGette served as the House Democrats' designated whip on the bill reauthorizing the State Children's Health Insurance Program (HR 3162).  Although President Bush announced his opposition to the legislation, the House passed the bill on August 1, 2007, by a vote of 225 to 204.  The Senate adopted a different version of the legislation the next day.

DeGette was also a cosponsor for the Udall Amendment to the House Energy Bill, which the House approved by a vote of 220 to 190 on August 4, 2007. The Amendment creates a national Renewable Energy Standard that requires electric suppliers to produce 15 percent of their energy from renewable sources, 4 percent of which can come from efficiency, by the year 2020. 

On September 12, 2007, DeGette announced that she would introduce the Colorado Wilderness Act of 2007 in Congress. The bill was unsuccessful and did not pass the committee level.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h110-3756 |title=H.R. 3756 [110th&#93;: Colorado Wilderness Act of 2007 |publisher=GovTrack.us |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22}}</ref> She reintroduced the bill in 2009.

She is a cosponsor of legislation to provide the [[District of Columbia]] voting representation.<ref>[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d109:HR02043: H.R. 2043 ("To establish the District of Columbia as a Congressional district for purposes of representation in the House of Representatives, and for other purposes.")]<!-- the USBill Template is not working properly: {{USBill|109|HR|2043}} --></ref>

On January 24, 2007, Speaker [[Nancy Pelosi]] appointed Representative DeGette to the [[House Page Board]].

On November 26, 2007, DeGette announced her endorsement of Senator [[Hillary Clinton]] for president, and was named national co-chair of Clinton's Health Care Policy Task Force and adviser on stem-cell research.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.hillaryclinton.com/news/release/view/?id=4370 |title=Colorado Rep. Diana DeGette Endorses Clinton}}</ref> DeGette was a [[superdelegate]] to the [[Democratic National Convention]] in [[Denver]] in August 2008.

DeGette was strongly critical of the [[Stupak-Pitts Amendment]], which places limits on taxpayer-funded abortions (except in the case of rape, incest, or life of the mother) in the context of the November 2009 [[Affordable Health Care for America Act]].

==Domestic policy views==

DeGette has consistently voted in favor of the use of embryonic stem cell research.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://votesmart.org/candidate/key-votes/561/diana-degette/77/stem-cell-research |title=Representative Diana DeGette - Stem Cell Research Voting Records |publisher=Project Vote Smart |accessdate=2013-06-19}}</ref> DeGette says “we must pass common-sense embryonic stem cell research legislation, placing these regulations into statute and once and for all, ensuring this critical life-saving research can be conducted for years to come, unimpeded by political whims or naysayers.” <ref>{{cite web|url=http://degette.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1083:degette-and-dent-introduce-stem-cell-legislation&catid=76:press-releases-&Itemid=227 |title=DeGette and Dent Introduce Stem Cell Legislation |publisher=Degette.house.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-06-19}}</ref> DeGette and [[Charlie Dent]] introduced the bipartisan Stem Cell Research Act of 2011, which would provide lasting support for stem cell research.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lillis |first=Mike |url=http://thehill.com/blogs/healthwatch/other/115661-degette-calls-for-legislation-overturning-courts-stem-cell-ruling |title=DeGette calls for legislation overturning court's stem cell ruling |publisher=The Hill's Healthwatch |date=2010-08-24 |accessdate=2013-06-19}}</ref>

===Gun control===
DeGette supports bans on semi-automatic firearms like those used in the [[2012 Aurora shooting]] which happened in a movie theatre near her district. DeGette believes that “the sole purpose of these guns and these magazines is to kill people.”<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/OonG |title=Representative DeGette on Gun Control |publisher=C-SPAN Video Library |date=2012-08-02 |accessdate=2013-06-19}}</ref> DeGette and Carolyn McCarthy introduced the Stop Online Ammunition Sales Act of 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://degette.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1223:degette-and-mccarthy-introduce-legislation-to-effectively-ban-online-ammo-sales&catid=76:press-releases-&Itemid=227 |title=DeGette and McCarthy Introduce Legislation to Effectively Ban Online Ammo Sales |publisher=Degette.house.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-06-19}}</ref> The [[Brady Campaign]] endorsed DeGette's reelection in 2008, 2010, and 2012.

According to a Denver Post Journalist, during a public hearing in [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]], April 2, 2013, DeGette did not appear to understand that a magazine can be reloaded with more ammunition. Instead she stated that it was "ammunition" and will get used up.<ref name="DenPost04032013Sherry">Sherry, Allison.

==Political campaigns==
===1996===
Longtime First District Congresswoman [[Patricia Schroeder|Pat Schroeder]] chose not to run for a 13th term in 1996, which prompted DeGette to run. Her principal opponent in the 1996 primary election was former City Council member Tim Sandos, whom Denver Mayor [[Wellington Webb]] endorsed shortly before the primary. DeGette won the [[Primary election|primary]] with 55 percent of the vote, all but assuring her of election in the heavily Democratic district (the 1st District has been in Democratic hands for all but six years since 1933). Schroeder, who stayed neutral during the primary, endorsed DeGette once DeGette became the Democratic nominee. DeGette won with 57 percent and has been reelected seven times since.

She is a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. The district is based in [[Denver]].

==Early life, education and career==
A fourth-generation Coloradan, DeGette was born in [[Tachikawa, Tokyo|Tachikawa]], [[Japan]], the daughter of Patricia Anne (''née'' Rose) and Richard Louis DeGette.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~battle/reps/degette.htm |title=Degette |publisher=Ancestry.com |accessdate=2013-06-19}}</ref> Her parents were American, and, at the time of her birth, her father was serving in the armed forces. She graduated from [[Colorado College]] where she earned a [[B.A.]] in [[political science]], and was elected to the [[Pi Gamma Mu]] international honor society in 1979<ref>{{cite web|title=Diana DeGette's Biography|url=http://votesmart.org/candidate/biography/561/diana-degette#.VJnSwV4AOB|website=Project Vote Smart|accessdate=23 December 2014}}</ref>. She earned a [[Juris Doctor]] degree from [[New York University]] in 1982. She then returned to Denver and began a law practice focusing on [[civil rights]] and employment litigation.

==Colorado Legislature==
Long active in Denver politics, she was elected to the [[Colorado General Assembly|Colorado House of Representatives]] in 1992. She was reelected in 1994 and chosen as assistant minority leader. She authored a law that guarantees Colorado women unobstructed access to [[abortion]] clinics and other medical care facilities, also known as the "Bubble Bill". The [[United States Supreme Court]] found DeGette's "Bubble Bill" constitutional in ''Hill v. Colorado'', 530 U.S. 703 (2000).

**[[United States House Energy Subcommittee on Environment and Economy|Subcommittee on Environment and Economy]]

===Party leadership===
*[[Chief Deputy Whips of the United States House of Representatives|Chief Deputy Whip]] (110th, 111th, 112th United States Congresses)

DeGette serves as the co-chair of both the Congressional [[Diabetes]] Caucus and [[Pro-Choice]] Caucus, and is Vice Chair of the [[LGBT Equality Caucus]]. With the Democrats' victory in the 2006 midterm elections, DeGette briefly considered running for [[House Majority Whip]], but bowed out in favor of [[Jim Clyburn]] of [[South Carolina]]. 

DeGette received national attention in 2005, when the House of Representatives passed legislation she cosponsored to lift President [[George W. Bush]]'s limits on federal funding for [[embryonic stem cell research]]. DeGette, who had been working on the measure since 2001, enlisted the support of Representative [[Michael N. Castle]] (Republican from Delaware), who became DeGette's principal Republican cosponsor of the legislation. The [[Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2005|DeGette-Castle bill]] passed the Senate on July 18, 2006. President Bush vetoed the bill the next day — [[List of United States presidential vetoes|his first veto]].

In 2007, DeGette served as the House Democrats' designated whip on the bill reauthorizing the State Children's Health Insurance Program (HR 3162).  Although President Bush announced his opposition to the legislation, the House passed the bill on August 1, 2007, by a vote of 225 to 204.  The Senate adopted a different version of the legislation the next day.

DeGette was also a cosponsor for the Udall Amendment to the House Energy Bill, which the House approved by a vote of 220 to 190 on August 4, 2007. The Amendment creates a national Renewable Energy Standard that requires electric suppliers to produce 15 percent of their energy from renewable sources, 4 percent of which can come from efficiency, by the year 2020. 

On September 12, 2007, DeGette announced that she would introduce the Colorado Wilderness Act of 2007 in Congress. The bill was unsuccessful and did not pass the committee level.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h110-3756 |title=H.R. 3756 [110th&#93;: Colorado Wilderness Act of 2007 |publisher=GovTrack.us |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22}}</ref> She reintroduced the bill in 2009.

She is a cosponsor of legislation to provide the [[District of Columbia]] voting representation.<ref>[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d109:HR02043: H.R. 2043 ("To establish the District of Columbia as a Congressional district for purposes of representation in the House of Representatives, and for other purposes.")]<!-- the USBill Template is not working properly: {{USBill|109|HR|2043}} --></ref>

On January 24, 2007, Speaker [[Nancy Pelosi]] appointed Representative DeGette to the [[House Page Board]].

On November 26, 2007, DeGette announced her endorsement of Senator [[Hillary Clinton]] for president, and was named national co-chair of Clinton's Health Care Policy Task Force and adviser on stem-cell research.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.hillaryclinton.com/news/release/view/?id=4370 |title=Colorado Rep. Diana DeGette Endorses Clinton}}</ref> DeGette was a [[superdelegate]] to the [[Democratic National Convention]] in [[Denver]] in August 2008.

DeGette was strongly critical of the [[Stupak-Pitts Amendment]], which places limits on taxpayer-funded abortions (except in the case of rape, incest, or life of the mother) in the context of the November 2009 [[Affordable Health Care for America Act]].

==Domestic policy views==
===Abortion===
DeGette is pro-choice and the co-chair of the Pro-Choice Caucus. DeGette and her fellow co-chair, [[Louise Slaughter]], are the sponsors of the Prevention First Act.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://degette.house.gov/index.php?Itemid=227&catid=76:press-releases-&id=494:pro-choice-caucus-co-chairs-us-reps-slaughter-and-degette-applaud-family-planning-funding-in-obamas-budget&option=com_content&view=article |title=Pro-Choice Caucus Co-Chairs U.S. Reps.

The [[NARAL Pro-Choice America]] PAC endorsed DeGette and gave her a 100% approval rating based on her positions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prochoiceamerica.org/elections/ |title=Elections |publisher=NARAL Pro-Choice America |accessdate=2013-06-19}}</ref><ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=http://votesmart.org/candidate/evaluations/561/diana-degette#.UKrzm4Wvxok |title=Diana DeGette - Ratings and Endorsements |publisher=Project Vote Smart |accessdate=2013-06-19}}</ref> DeGette also received a 100% rating from [[Planned Parenthood]].<ref name=autogenerated1 /> The National Right to Life Committee gave her a 0% rating due to her strong pro-choice stance.<ref name=autogenerated1 />

===Embryonic stem cell research===
DeGette has consistently voted in favor of the use of embryonic stem cell research.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://votesmart.org/candidate/key-votes/561/diana-degette/77/stem-cell-research |title=Representative Diana DeGette - Stem Cell Research Voting Records |publisher=Project Vote Smart |accessdate=2013-06-19}}</ref> DeGette says “we must pass common-sense embryonic stem cell research legislation, placing these regulations into statute and once and for all, ensuring this critical life-saving research can be conducted for years to come, unimpeded by political whims or naysayers.” <ref>{{cite web|url=http://degette.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1083:degette-and-dent-introduce-stem-cell-legislation&catid=76:press-releases-&Itemid=227 |title=DeGette and Dent Introduce Stem Cell Legislation |publisher=Degette.house.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-06-19}}</ref> DeGette and [[Charlie Dent]] introduced the bipartisan Stem Cell Research Act of 2011, which would provide lasting support for stem cell research.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lillis |first=Mike |url=http://thehill.com/blogs/healthwatch/other/115661-degette-calls-for-legislation-overturning-courts-stem-cell-ruling |title=DeGette calls for legislation overturning court's stem cell ruling |publisher=The Hill's Healthwatch |date=2010-08-24 |accessdate=2013-06-19}}</ref>

===Gun control===
DeGette supports bans on semi-automatic firearms like those used in the [[2012 Aurora shooting]] which happened in a movie theatre near her district. DeGette believes that “the sole purpose of these guns and these magazines is to kill people.”<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/OonG |title=Representative DeGette on Gun Control |publisher=C-SPAN Video Library |date=2012-08-02 |accessdate=2013-06-19}}</ref> DeGette and Carolyn McCarthy introduced the Stop Online Ammunition Sales Act of 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://degette.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1223:degette-and-mccarthy-introduce-legislation-to-effectively-ban-online-ammo-sales&catid=76:press-releases-&Itemid=227 |title=DeGette and McCarthy Introduce Legislation to Effectively Ban Online Ammo Sales |publisher=Degette.house.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-06-19}}</ref> The [[Brady Campaign]] endorsed DeGette's reelection in 2008, 2010, and 2012.

According to a Denver Post Journalist, during a public hearing in [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]], April 2, 2013, DeGette did not appear to understand that a magazine can be reloaded with more ammunition. Instead she stated that it was "ammunition" and will get used up.<ref name="DenPost04032013Sherry">Sherry, Allison.

DeGette won the [[Primary election|primary]] with 55 percent of the vote, all but assuring her of election in the heavily Democratic district (the 1st District has been in Democratic hands for all but six years since 1933).
