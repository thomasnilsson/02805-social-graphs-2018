===Legislation===
On May 8, 2013, Garrett introduced the [[Budget and Accounting Transparency Act of 2014 (H.R. 1872; 113th Congress)]], a bill that would modify the budgetary treatment of federal credit programs.<ref name=1872cbo>{{cite web|title=H.R. 1872 - CBO|url=http://cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/hr1872.pdf|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=28 March 2014}}</ref> The bill would require that the cost of direct loans or loan guarantees be recognized in the federal budget on a fair-value basis using guidelines set forth by the [[Financial Accounting Standards Board]].<ref name="1872cbo"/> The bill would also require the federal budget to reflect the net impact of programs administered by [[Fannie Mae]] and [[Freddie Mac]].<ref name="1872cbo"/> The changes made by the bill would mean that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were counted on the budget instead of considered separately and would mean that the debt of those two programs would be included in the national debt.<ref name=Housepushbudgetreform>{{cite news|last=Kasperowicz|first=Pete|title=House to push budget reforms next week|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/economics-trade/202010-house-to-push-budget-reforms-next-week|accessdate=7 April 2014|newspaper=The Hill|date=28 March 2014}}</ref> These programs themselves would not be changed, but how they are accounted for in the [[United States federal budget]] would be. The goal of the bill is to improve the accuracy of how some programs are accounted for in the federal budget.<ref name=bringoutbudget>{{cite news|last=Kasperowicz|first=Pete|title=Next week: Bring out the budget|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/scheduling/202730-next-week-bring-out-the-budget|accessdate=7 April 2014|newspaper=The Hill|date=4 April 2014}}</ref>

==Political positions==
Although Garrett promoted himself as a "mainstream tax-cutter that [[George W. Bush|President Bush]] needs in Congress,"<ref>Archive of Garrett's campaign site at http://web.archive.org/web/20030425222436/http://garrettforcongress.com</ref> he broke with the Bush Administration several times.

He also serves on the [[Liberty Caucus]] (despite opposing the legalization of online poker), a group of [[Libertarianism|libertarian]]-minded congressmen.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.thelibertycommittee.org/|title= The Liberty Committee|accessdate=2007-06-24}}</ref> Other members include(ed) [[Ron Paul]] of [[Texas]], [[Jimmy Duncan (U.S. politician)|Jimmy Duncan]] of [[Tennessee]], [[Roscoe Bartlett]] of [[Maryland]], [[Walter B.

===Foreign policy===
In 2007, Garrett led nineteen US lawmakers to introduce a bill in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] backing [[United Nations member states|UN membership]] for [[Republic of China|Taiwan]], contrary to U.S. policy since [[Richard M. Nixon|Nixon]].<ref>[http://www.chinapost.com.tw/news/2007/11/11/130375/The-Ministry.htm The Ministry of Foreign Affairs welcomes legislation introduced by 19 lawmakers], ''[[The China Post]]'', November 11, 2007</ref> Garrett is a staunch supporter of military aid to Israel as well as sanctions against Iran.

In July 2007, Congressman Garrett proposed an amendment to strike money in a spending bill for native [[Alaska]]n and [[Hawaii]]an educational programs.<ref name="young">[http://www.politico.com/blogs/thecrypt/0707/North_to_Alaska.html North to Alaska], ''The Politico'' dated July 17, 2007.</ref> Congressman [[Don Young]] of Alaska defended the funds on the floor of the House, saying, "You want my money, my money."<ref name="young"/> Young went on to suggest that conservative Republicans such as Garrett lost the Republicans their majority in the 2006 election by challenging spending [[earmarks]]{{disambiguation needed|date=September 2012}}, and made several critical remarks about the state of New Jersey.<ref name="young"/> While Garrett did not ask for an official reprimand, other conservative Republicans took exception to Young's remarks that the funds in question represented his money. Members of the [[Republican Study Committee]] gave Garrett a standing ovation later in the day during the group's weekly meeting.<ref name="young"/>

====Suffrage====
Garrett was the only congressman from New Jersey to vote against the reauthorization of the [[Voting Rights Act]] for purposes of [[states' rights]].<ref name=Record>[http://www.bergen.com/page.php?qstr=eXJpcnk3ZjcxN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXkxNCZmZ2JlbDdmN3ZxZWVFRXl5Njk2Mjg5NQ== The unending struggle for voting rights], ''[[The Record (Bergen County)]]'', July 18, 2006 {{Dead link|date=December 2009}}</ref>

===Other===
Garrett led a drive to demand the immediate resignation of Governor [[Jim McGreevey]] after he admitted to an [[adultery|extramarital affair]] with a male state employee. McGreevey announced that he would stay in office until November 15, 2004. Had McGreevey resigned before September 8, 2004, there would have been a special election at the same time as that year's presidential election. Garrett started a petition on his campaign web site demanding a special election.  According to his campaign manager, it received 10,000 responses.

In November 2009, Garrett met at the [[United States Capitol]] with protesting [[Tea Party protests|"tea party"]] constituents.  After [[birther]]s harangued him for several minutes, he agreed  President [[Barack Obama]] should produce an original [[birth certificate]] to verify his eligibility to be [[President of the United States]].<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baVFhC-_oKM Video: No Obama Birth Certificate 11/5/09 Scott Garrett DC House Call], [[NJCommonSense]], November 5, 2009</ref><ref>{{cite web

==Political campaigns==
{{BLP sources section|  date=October 2013}}
Garrett ran for Congress unsuccessfully against incumbent Congresswoman [[Marge Roukema]] in the 1998 and 2000 Republican primaries, falling short both times with 48% of the vote.<ref>[http://www.naco.org/cnews/2001/01-11-26/roukema.htm Roukema retires], ''County News Online'', November 26, 2001</ref> He received support from several groups who had long felt chagrin at Roukema's moderate voting record; Garrett had by this time established himself as one of the most [[conservatism in the United States|conservative]] members of the General Assembly.

In 2002, Roukema opted not to run for a 12th term. Garrett won a contested five-way primary with 45% of the vote over State Assemblyman [[David C. Russo]] (26%) and [[New Jersey Senate|State Senator]] [[Gerald Cardinale]] (25%), who had received Roukema's endorsement.<ref>Kocieniewski, David. [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9402E5D91E3AF936A35755C0A9649C8B63&scp=1&sq=garrett+russo+roukema&st=nyt "Forrester to Represent G.O.P. in Race to Unseat Torricelli"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', June 5, 2002. Accessed March 30, 2008. "In the Republican primary to replace Representative Marge Roukema, who is retiring from her Fifth Congressional District seat, State Assemblyman E. Scott Garrett, defeated State Senator Gerald Cardinale, whom Mrs. Roukema had endorsed. With all precincts reporting, Mr. Garrett had 46 percent, to 25 percent for Mr. Cardinale and 26 percent for Assemblyman David C. Russo."</ref><ref>[http://www.voterzview.com/Weekly/38_070502.htm Barnes Pleads Guilty, Primaries, & Georgia Scott; 38th Column] dated July 5, 2002</ref>

In the 2002 general election, Garrett faced [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidate Anne Sumers, an [[ophthalmologist]] and former Republican. Roukema did not endorse Garrett in the general election. Roukema did not endorse Sumers either, even though part of Sumers' strategy was to portray herself as a "Roukema Republican" and win support in Roukema's old [[Bergen County]] base (Bergen County is the biggest county in the 5th district). Sumers' chances decreased significantly after she made several ill-advised comments about the U.S.-[[Taliban]] conflict on an Internet message board.<ref>[http://www.csmonitor.com/2002/0705/p02s01-uspo.html Patriotism becomes nasty campaign issue], csmonitor.com, July 5, 2002; accessed October 31, 2014.</ref> The race essentially ended at that point, and Garrett won in a rout, 60% to 38% - even winning Roukema's former base in Bergen County.<ref>[http://www.jrn.columbia.edu/studentwork/election/2002/senate/republicans.asp In Jersey, Conservative and Moderate Republicans Vie for Control of Party], jrn/columbia/edu; accessed July 31, 2006.</ref><ref>{{cite book|page=1043|chapter=New Jersey 5th District|title=[[Almanac of American Politics]] 2004|authorlink1=Michael Barone (pundit)|first1=Michael|last1=Barone|authorlink2=Richard E.

Garrett was reelected in 2004 with 58% of the vote. He declined to debate his opponent [[Anne Wolfe]], several times, claiming to have conflicts with his schedule in [[Washington D.C.]] Eventually he debated her twice. In 2006, Garrett defeated his Republican primary rival, Michael J. Cino of Bergen County. In the [[New Jersey's 5th congressional district election, 2006|November 2006 election]], Garrett defeated [[Paul Aronsohn]], a former employee of the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] during the [[Clinton Administration]] and Independent R. Matthew Fretz to win a third term.  However, in this election, he only won 55% of the vote—the lowest percentage for a Republican in the district since it assumed its current configuration in 1983. The 2006 election was close enough to attract the attention of the [[Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee|DCCC]], who targeted the 5th District for a pickup in 2008. The [[Democratic Party (US)|Democratic Party]] nominated [[Dennis Shulman]], a highly respected [[rabbi]] and [[psychologist]], as their nominee in 2008. Garrett defeated Shulman 56%-42% in the [[United States House of Representatives elections in New Jersey, 2008|2008 general election]]. {{cn|date=November 2014}}

In 2010, Garrett defeated Tod Theise, receiving 65% of the vote. 

In 2014, Garrett faced Democratic nominee Roy Cho.<ref>[http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/08/at_unofficial_start_of_election_season_national_parties_are_focusing_on_1_nj_congressional_district.html#incart_river Garrett v Cho], nj.com; accessed October 31, 2014.</ref> The two largest newspapers in New Jersey both endorsed Cho. ''[[The Star-Ledger]]'' called Garrett "a retrograde culture warrior who wants to eliminate a woman’s right to choose", and criticized his support for [[Budget sequestration in 2013|the 2013 budget sequester]], which has been accused of hurting New Jersey; by contrast, Cho was called "a centrist who actually wants to govern."<ref>{{cite news|title=Roy Cho for Congress in the fifth district: Editorial|newspaper=[[The Star-Ledger]]|date=October 26, 2014|url=http://www.nj.com/opinion/index.ssf/2014/10/roy_cho_for_congress_in_the_fifth_district_editorial.html|accessdate=2014-10-27}}</ref> ''[[The Record (Bergen County)|The Bergen Record]]'' criticized Garrett as "a dogmatic conservative who believes ideology trumps compromise" and agreed with Cho's call for a federal role in improving the region's transportation infrastructure.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Record: Cho in the 5th District|newspaper=[[The Record (Bergen County)|The Bergen Record]]|date=October 26, 2014|url=http://www.northjersey.com/opinion/opinion-editorials/cho-in-the-5th-1.1118228#sthash.QID3Fo9p.dpuf|accessdate=2014-10-27}} </ref> Garrett won the midterm election.<ref>http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/04/scott-garrett-midterm-election-results_n_5917652.html</ref>

===Legislation===
On May 8, 2013, Garrett introduced the [[Budget and Accounting Transparency Act of 2014 (H.R. 1872; 113th Congress)]], a bill that would modify the budgetary treatment of federal credit programs.<ref name=1872cbo>{{cite web|title=H.R. 1872 - CBO|url=http://cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/hr1872.pdf|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=28 March 2014}}</ref> The bill would require that the cost of direct loans or loan guarantees be recognized in the federal budget on a fair-value basis using guidelines set forth by the [[Financial Accounting Standards Board]].<ref name="1872cbo"/> The bill would also require the federal budget to reflect the net impact of programs administered by [[Fannie Mae]] and [[Freddie Mac]].<ref name="1872cbo"/> The changes made by the bill would mean that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were counted on the budget instead of considered separately and would mean that the debt of those two programs would be included in the national debt.<ref name=Housepushbudgetreform>{{cite news|last=Kasperowicz|first=Pete|title=House to push budget reforms next week|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/economics-trade/202010-house-to-push-budget-reforms-next-week|accessdate=7 April 2014|newspaper=The Hill|date=28 March 2014}}</ref> These programs themselves would not be changed, but how they are accounted for in the [[United States federal budget]] would be. The goal of the bill is to improve the accuracy of how some programs are accounted for in the federal budget.<ref name=bringoutbudget>{{cite news|last=Kasperowicz|first=Pete|title=Next week: Bring out the budget|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/scheduling/202730-next-week-bring-out-the-budget|accessdate=7 April 2014|newspaper=The Hill|date=4 April 2014}}</ref>

==Political positions==
Although Garrett promoted himself as a "mainstream tax-cutter that [[George W. Bush|President Bush]] needs in Congress,"<ref>Archive of Garrett's campaign site at http://web.archive.org/web/20030425222436/http://garrettforcongress.com</ref> he broke with the Bush Administration several times.

He also serves on the [[Liberty Caucus]] (despite opposing the legalization of online poker), a group of [[Libertarianism|libertarian]]-minded congressmen.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.thelibertycommittee.org/|title= The Liberty Committee|accessdate=2007-06-24}}</ref> Other members include(ed) [[Ron Paul]] of [[Texas]], [[Jimmy Duncan (U.S. politician)|Jimmy Duncan]] of [[Tennessee]], [[Roscoe Bartlett]] of [[Maryland]], [[Walter B. Jones]] of [[North Carolina]], and [[Jeff Flake]] of [[Arizona]].<ref name="nytimesmagazine">{{cite news | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/22/magazine/22Paul-t.html?_r=2&oref=slogin&oref=slogin | title = The Antiwar, Anti-Abortion, Anti-Drug-Enforcement-Administration, Anti-Medicare Candidacy of Dr. Ron Paul  | first = Christopher | last = Caldwell | work = [[The New York Times Magazine]] | date = 2007-07-22 | accessdate = 2007-07-21}}</ref>

===Foreign policy===
In 2007, Garrett led nineteen US lawmakers to introduce a bill in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] backing [[United Nations member states|UN membership]] for [[Republic of China|Taiwan]], contrary to U.S. policy since [[Richard M. Nixon|Nixon]].<ref>[http://www.chinapost.com.tw/news/2007/11/11/130375/The-Ministry.htm The Ministry of Foreign Affairs welcomes legislation introduced by 19 lawmakers], ''[[The China Post]]'', November 11, 2007</ref> Garrett is a staunch supporter of military aid to Israel as well as sanctions against Iran.

In 2008, he opposed H.R. 5767, the Payment Systems Protection Act (a bill that sought to place a moratorium on enforcement of the [[Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act]] while the [[U.S. Treasury Department]] and the [[Federal Reserve]] defined "unlawful Internet gambling"). He was the only member of the New Jersey delegation to vote for [[Off shore oil drilling|oil and gas drilling off the shore]] of New Jersey.<ref>[http://www.nj.com/news/ledger/index.ssf?/base/news-7/1151647828208030.xml&coll=1&thispage=1 House votes to lift drilling ban for offshore natural gas and oil], ''[[Star-Ledger]]'', June 30, 2006</ref> Garrett was also the only member to vote against restrictions on "[[price gouging]]" by [[oil companies]],<ref>[http://www.northjersey.com/page.php?qstr=eXJpcnk3ZjcxN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXkyJmZnYmVsN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXk2OTMwMzMy "Garrett hit for vote against gas price-gouging ban"], ''[[The Record (Bergen County)]]'', May 6, 2006.</ref> to vote against [[child safety lock]]s on handguns, and to vote against emergency funding for [[Hurricane Katrina]] victims.<ref>[http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2005/roll460.xml Roll Call: Further Emergency Supplemental Appropriations, Hurricane Katrina, 2005], September 8, 2005</ref> He was the only New Jersey member to vote against federal aid for [[Pet|household pets]] in case of a disaster.<ref>[http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2006/roll178.xml Roll Call: Pets Evacuation and Transportation Standards Act], May 22, 2006</ref> He was one of only four members of the House of Representatives to vote against an extension of [[unemployment benefits]].<ref>[http://www.komotv.com/news/story.asp?ID=22346 Bush Signs Extension of Federal Unemployment Benefits], [[KOMO-TV]], January 8, 2003</ref> 

Garrett was the only member of the New Jersey delegation that voted to keep the government closed during the [[United States federal government shutdown of 2013]].<ref>[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/113-2013/h550 Garrett's vote for federal government shutdown of 2013], govtrack.us; accessed October 31, 2014.</ref> He was also the only member of the New Jersey congressional delegation to refuse to sign a letter urging the House to provide relief to victims of [[Hurricane Sandy]].

In July 2007, Congressman Garrett proposed an amendment to strike money in a spending bill for native [[Alaska]]n and [[Hawaii]]an educational programs.<ref name="young">[http://www.politico.com/blogs/thecrypt/0707/North_to_Alaska.html North to Alaska], ''The Politico'' dated July 17, 2007.</ref> Congressman [[Don Young]] of Alaska defended the funds on the floor of the House, saying, "You want my money, my money."<ref name="young"/> Young went on to suggest that conservative Republicans such as Garrett lost the Republicans their majority in the 2006 election by challenging spending [[earmarks]]{{disambiguation needed|date=September 2012}}, and made several critical remarks about the state of New Jersey.<ref name="young"/> While Garrett did not ask for an official reprimand, other conservative Republicans took exception to Young's remarks that the funds in question represented his money. Members of the [[Republican Study Committee]] gave Garrett a standing ovation later in the day during the group's weekly meeting.<ref name="young"/>

====Suffrage====
Garrett was the only congressman from New Jersey to vote against the reauthorization of the [[Voting Rights Act]] for purposes of [[states' rights]].<ref name=Record>[http://www.bergen.com/page.php?qstr=eXJpcnk3ZjcxN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXkxNCZmZ2JlbDdmN3ZxZWVFRXl5Njk2Mjg5NQ== The unending struggle for voting rights], ''[[The Record (Bergen County)]]'', July 18, 2006 {{Dead link|date=December 2009}}</ref>

===Other===
Garrett led a drive to demand the immediate resignation of Governor [[Jim McGreevey]] after he admitted to an [[adultery|extramarital affair]] with a male state employee. McGreevey announced that he would stay in office until November 15, 2004. Had McGreevey resigned before September 8, 2004, there would have been a special election at the same time as that year's presidential election. Garrett started a petition on his campaign web site demanding a special election.  According to his campaign manager, it received 10,000 responses.

In November 2009, Garrett met at the [[United States Capitol]] with protesting [[Tea Party protests|"tea party"]] constituents.  After [[birther]]s harangued him for several minutes, he agreed  President [[Barack Obama]] should produce an original [[birth certificate]] to verify his eligibility to be [[President of the United States]].<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baVFhC-_oKM Video: No Obama Birth Certificate 11/5/09 Scott Garrett DC House Call], [[NJCommonSense]], November 5, 2009</ref><ref>{{cite web

==Political campaigns==
{{BLP sources section|  date=October 2013}}
Garrett ran for Congress unsuccessfully against incumbent Congresswoman [[Marge Roukema]] in the 1998 and 2000 Republican primaries, falling short both times with 48% of the vote.<ref>[http://www.naco.org/cnews/2001/01-11-26/roukema.htm Roukema retires], ''County News Online'', November 26, 2001</ref> He received support from several groups who had long felt chagrin at Roukema's moderate voting record; Garrett had by this time established himself as one of the most [[conservatism in the United States|conservative]] members of the General Assembly.

In 2002, Roukema opted not to run for a 12th term. Garrett won a contested five-way primary with 45% of the vote over State Assemblyman [[David C. Russo]] (26%) and [[New Jersey Senate|State Senator]] [[Gerald Cardinale]] (25%), who had received Roukema's endorsement.<ref>Kocieniewski, David. [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9402E5D91E3AF936A35755C0A9649C8B63&scp=1&sq=garrett+russo+roukema&st=nyt "Forrester to Represent G.O.P. in Race to Unseat Torricelli"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', June 5, 2002. Accessed March 30, 2008. "In the Republican primary to replace Representative Marge Roukema, who is retiring from her Fifth Congressional District seat, State Assemblyman E. Scott Garrett, defeated State Senator Gerald Cardinale, whom Mrs. Roukema had endorsed. With all precincts reporting, Mr. Garrett had 46 percent, to 25 percent for Mr. Cardinale and 26 percent for Assemblyman David C. Russo."</ref><ref>[http://www.voterzview.com/Weekly/38_070502.htm Barnes Pleads Guilty, Primaries, & Georgia Scott; 38th Column] dated July 5, 2002</ref>

In the 2002 general election, Garrett faced [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidate Anne Sumers, an [[ophthalmologist]] and former Republican. Roukema did not endorse Garrett in the general election. Roukema did not endorse Sumers either, even though part of Sumers' strategy was to portray herself as a "Roukema Republican" and win support in Roukema's old [[Bergen County]] base (Bergen County is the biggest county in the 5th district). Sumers' chances decreased significantly after she made several ill-advised comments about the U.S.-[[Taliban]] conflict on an Internet message board.<ref>[http://www.csmonitor.com/2002/0705/p02s01-uspo.html Patriotism becomes nasty campaign issue], csmonitor.com, July 5, 2002; accessed October 31, 2014.</ref> The race essentially ended at that point, and Garrett won in a rout, 60% to 38% - even winning Roukema's former base in Bergen County.<ref>[http://www.jrn.columbia.edu/studentwork/election/2002/senate/republicans.asp In Jersey, Conservative and Moderate Republicans Vie for Control of Party], jrn/columbia/edu; accessed July 31, 2006.</ref><ref>{{cite book|page=1043|chapter=New Jersey 5th District|title=[[Almanac of American Politics]] 2004|authorlink1=Michael Barone (pundit)|first1=Michael|last1=Barone|authorlink2=Richard E.

Garrett was reelected in 2004 with 58% of the vote. He declined to debate his opponent [[Anne Wolfe]], several times, claiming to have conflicts with his schedule in [[Washington D.C.]] Eventually he debated her twice. In 2006, Garrett defeated his Republican primary rival, Michael J. Cino of Bergen County. In the [[New Jersey's 5th congressional district election, 2006|November 2006 election]], Garrett defeated [[Paul Aronsohn]], a former employee of the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] during the [[Clinton Administration]] and Independent R. Matthew Fretz to win a third term.  However, in this election, he only won 55% of the vote—the lowest percentage for a Republican in the district since it assumed its current configuration in 1983. The 2006 election was close enough to attract the attention of the [[Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee|DCCC]], who targeted the 5th District for a pickup in 2008. The [[Democratic Party (US)|Democratic Party]] nominated [[Dennis Shulman]], a highly respected [[rabbi]] and [[psychologist]], as their nominee in 2008. Garrett defeated Shulman 56%-42% in the [[United States House of Representatives elections in New Jersey, 2008|2008 general election]]. {{cn|date=November 2014}}

In 2010, Garrett defeated Tod Theise, receiving 65% of the vote. 

In 2014, Garrett faced Democratic nominee Roy Cho.<ref>[http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/08/at_unofficial_start_of_election_season_national_parties_are_focusing_on_1_nj_congressional_district.html#incart_river Garrett v Cho], nj.com; accessed October 31, 2014.</ref> The two largest newspapers in New Jersey both endorsed Cho. ''[[The Star-Ledger]]'' called Garrett "a retrograde culture warrior who wants to eliminate a woman’s right to choose", and criticized his support for [[Budget sequestration in 2013|the 2013 budget sequester]], which has been accused of hurting New Jersey; by contrast, Cho was called "a centrist who actually wants to govern."<ref>{{cite news|title=Roy Cho for Congress in the fifth district: Editorial|newspaper=[[The Star-Ledger]]|date=October 26, 2014|url=http://www.nj.com/opinion/index.ssf/2014/10/roy_cho_for_congress_in_the_fifth_district_editorial.html|accessdate=2014-10-27}}</ref> ''[[The Record (Bergen County)|The Bergen Record]]'' criticized Garrett as "a dogmatic conservative who believes ideology trumps compromise" and agreed with Cho's call for a federal role in improving the region's transportation infrastructure.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Record: Cho in the 5th District|newspaper=[[The Record (Bergen County)|The Bergen Record]]|date=October 26, 2014|url=http://www.northjersey.com/opinion/opinion-editorials/cho-in-the-5th-1.1118228#sthash.QID3Fo9p.dpuf|accessdate=2014-10-27}} </ref> Garrett won the midterm election.<ref>http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/04/scott-garrett-midterm-election-results_n_5917652.html</ref>

===Legislation===
On May 8, 2013, Garrett introduced the [[Budget and Accounting Transparency Act of 2014 (H.R. 1872; 113th Congress)]], a bill that would modify the budgetary treatment of federal credit programs.<ref name=1872cbo>{{cite web|title=H.R. 1872 - CBO|url=http://cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/hr1872.pdf|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=28 March 2014}}</ref> The bill would require that the cost of direct loans or loan guarantees be recognized in the federal budget on a fair-value basis using guidelines set forth by the [[Financial Accounting Standards Board]].<ref name="1872cbo"/> The bill would also require the federal budget to reflect the net impact of programs administered by [[Fannie Mae]] and [[Freddie Mac]].<ref name="1872cbo"/> The changes made by the bill would mean that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were counted on the budget instead of considered separately and would mean that the debt of those two programs would be included in the national debt.<ref name=Housepushbudgetreform>{{cite news|last=Kasperowicz|first=Pete|title=House to push budget reforms next week|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/economics-trade/202010-house-to-push-budget-reforms-next-week|accessdate=7 April 2014|newspaper=The Hill|date=28 March 2014}}</ref> These programs themselves would not be changed, but how they are accounted for in the [[United States federal budget]] would be. The goal of the bill is to improve the accuracy of how some programs are accounted for in the federal budget.<ref name=bringoutbudget>{{cite news|last=Kasperowicz|first=Pete|title=Next week: Bring out the budget|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/scheduling/202730-next-week-bring-out-the-budget|accessdate=7 April 2014|newspaper=The Hill|date=4 April 2014}}</ref>

==Political positions==
Although Garrett promoted himself as a "mainstream tax-cutter that [[George W. Bush|President Bush]] needs in Congress,"<ref>Archive of Garrett's campaign site at http://web.archive.org/web/20030425222436/http://garrettforcongress.com</ref> he broke with the Bush Administration several times.

He also serves on the [[Liberty Caucus]] (despite opposing the legalization of online poker), a group of [[Libertarianism|libertarian]]-minded congressmen.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.thelibertycommittee.org/|title= The Liberty Committee|accessdate=2007-06-24}}</ref> Other members include(ed) [[Ron Paul]] of [[Texas]], [[Jimmy Duncan (U.S. politician)|Jimmy Duncan]] of [[Tennessee]], [[Roscoe Bartlett]] of [[Maryland]], [[Walter B. Jones]] of [[North Carolina]], and [[Jeff Flake]] of [[Arizona]].<ref name="nytimesmagazine">{{cite news | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/22/magazine/22Paul-t.html?_r=2&oref=slogin&oref=slogin | title = The Antiwar, Anti-Abortion, Anti-Drug-Enforcement-Administration, Anti-Medicare Candidacy of Dr. Ron Paul  | first = Christopher | last = Caldwell | work = [[The New York Times Magazine]] | date = 2007-07-22 | accessdate = 2007-07-21}}</ref>

===Foreign policy===
In 2007, Garrett led nineteen US lawmakers to introduce a bill in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] backing [[United Nations member states|UN membership]] for [[Republic of China|Taiwan]], contrary to U.S. policy since [[Richard M. Nixon|Nixon]].<ref>[http://www.chinapost.com.tw/news/2007/11/11/130375/The-Ministry.htm The Ministry of Foreign Affairs welcomes legislation introduced by 19 lawmakers], ''[[The China Post]]'', November 11, 2007</ref> Garrett is a staunch supporter of military aid to Israel as well as sanctions against Iran.

In 2008, he opposed H.R. 5767, the Payment Systems Protection Act (a bill that sought to place a moratorium on enforcement of the [[Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act]] while the [[U.S. Treasury Department]] and the [[Federal Reserve]] defined "unlawful Internet gambling"). He was the only member of the New Jersey delegation to vote for [[Off shore oil drilling|oil and gas drilling off the shore]] of New Jersey.<ref>[http://www.nj.com/news/ledger/index.ssf?/base/news-7/1151647828208030.xml&coll=1&thispage=1 House votes to lift drilling ban for offshore natural gas and oil], ''[[Star-Ledger]]'', June 30, 2006</ref> Garrett was also the only member to vote against restrictions on "[[price gouging]]" by [[oil companies]],<ref>[http://www.northjersey.com/page.php?qstr=eXJpcnk3ZjcxN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXkyJmZnYmVsN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXk2OTMwMzMy "Garrett hit for vote against gas price-gouging ban"], ''[[The Record (Bergen County)]]'', May 6, 2006.</ref> to vote against [[child safety lock]]s on handguns, and to vote against emergency funding for [[Hurricane Katrina]] victims.<ref>[http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2005/roll460.xml Roll Call: Further Emergency Supplemental Appropriations, Hurricane Katrina, 2005], September 8, 2005</ref> He was the only New Jersey member to vote against federal aid for [[Pet|household pets]] in case of a disaster.<ref>[http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2006/roll178.xml Roll Call: Pets Evacuation and Transportation Standards Act], May 22, 2006</ref> He was one of only four members of the House of Representatives to vote against an extension of [[unemployment benefits]].<ref>[http://www.komotv.com/news/story.asp?ID=22346 Bush Signs Extension of Federal Unemployment Benefits], [[KOMO-TV]], January 8, 2003</ref> 

Garrett was the only member of the New Jersey delegation that voted to keep the government closed during the [[United States federal government shutdown of 2013]].<ref>[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/113-2013/h550 Garrett's vote for federal government shutdown of 2013], govtrack.us; accessed October 31, 2014.</ref> He was also the only member of the New Jersey congressional delegation to refuse to sign a letter urging the House to provide relief to victims of [[Hurricane Sandy]].

In July 2007, Congressman Garrett proposed an amendment to strike money in a spending bill for native [[Alaska]]n and [[Hawaii]]an educational programs.<ref name="young">[http://www.politico.com/blogs/thecrypt/0707/North_to_Alaska.html North to Alaska], ''The Politico'' dated July 17, 2007.</ref> Congressman [[Don Young]] of Alaska defended the funds on the floor of the House, saying, "You want my money, my money."<ref name="young"/> Young went on to suggest that conservative Republicans such as Garrett lost the Republicans their majority in the 2006 election by challenging spending [[earmarks]]{{disambiguation needed|date=September 2012}}, and made several critical remarks about the state of New Jersey.<ref name="young"/> While Garrett did not ask for an official reprimand, other conservative Republicans took exception to Young's remarks that the funds in question represented his money. Members of the [[Republican Study Committee]] gave Garrett a standing ovation later in the day during the group's weekly meeting.<ref name="young"/>

====Suffrage====
Garrett was the only congressman from New Jersey to vote against the reauthorization of the [[Voting Rights Act]] for purposes of [[states' rights]].<ref name=Record>[http://www.bergen.com/page.php?qstr=eXJpcnk3ZjcxN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXkxNCZmZ2JlbDdmN3ZxZWVFRXl5Njk2Mjg5NQ== The unending struggle for voting rights], ''[[The Record (Bergen County)]]'', July 18, 2006 {{Dead link|date=December 2009}}</ref>

===Other===
Garrett led a drive to demand the immediate resignation of Governor [[Jim McGreevey]] after he admitted to an [[adultery|extramarital affair]] with a male state employee. McGreevey announced that he would stay in office until November 15, 2004. Had McGreevey resigned before September 8, 2004, there would have been a special election at the same time as that year's presidential election. Garrett started a petition on his campaign web site demanding a special election.  According to his campaign manager, it received 10,000 responses.

In November 2009, Garrett met at the [[United States Capitol]] with protesting [[Tea Party protests|"tea party"]] constituents.  After [[birther]]s harangued him for several minutes, he agreed  President [[Barack Obama]] should produce an original [[birth certificate]] to verify his eligibility to be [[President of the United States]].<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baVFhC-_oKM Video: No Obama Birth Certificate 11/5/09 Scott Garrett DC House Call], [[NJCommonSense]], November 5, 2009</ref><ref>{{cite web

==Political campaigns==
{{BLP sources section|  date=October 2013}}
Garrett ran for Congress unsuccessfully against incumbent Congresswoman [[Marge Roukema]] in the 1998 and 2000 Republican primaries, falling short both times with 48% of the vote.<ref>[http://www.naco.org/cnews/2001/01-11-26/roukema.htm Roukema retires], ''County News Online'', November 26, 2001</ref> He received support from several groups who had long felt chagrin at Roukema's moderate voting record; Garrett had by this time established himself as one of the most [[conservatism in the United States|conservative]] members of the General Assembly.

In 2002, Roukema opted not to run for a 12th term. Garrett won a contested five-way primary with 45% of the vote over State Assemblyman [[David C. Russo]] (26%) and [[New Jersey Senate|State Senator]] [[Gerald Cardinale]] (25%), who had received Roukema's endorsement.<ref>Kocieniewski, David. [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9402E5D91E3AF936A35755C0A9649C8B63&scp=1&sq=garrett+russo+roukema&st=nyt "Forrester to Represent G.O.P. in Race to Unseat Torricelli"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', June 5, 2002. Accessed March 30, 2008. "In the Republican primary to replace Representative Marge Roukema, who is retiring from her Fifth Congressional District seat, State Assemblyman E. Scott Garrett, defeated State Senator Gerald Cardinale, whom Mrs. Roukema had endorsed. With all precincts reporting, Mr. Garrett had 46 percent, to 25 percent for Mr. Cardinale and 26 percent for Assemblyman David C. Russo."</ref><ref>[http://www.voterzview.com/Weekly/38_070502.htm Barnes Pleads Guilty, Primaries, & Georgia Scott; 38th Column] dated July 5, 2002</ref>

In the 2002 general election, Garrett faced [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidate Anne Sumers, an [[ophthalmologist]] and former Republican. Roukema did not endorse Garrett in the general election. Roukema did not endorse Sumers either, even though part of Sumers' strategy was to portray herself as a "Roukema Republican" and win support in Roukema's old [[Bergen County]] base (Bergen County is the biggest county in the 5th district). Sumers' chances decreased significantly after she made several ill-advised comments about the U.S.-[[Taliban]] conflict on an Internet message board.<ref>[http://www.csmonitor.com/2002/0705/p02s01-uspo.html Patriotism becomes nasty campaign issue], csmonitor.com, July 5, 2002; accessed October 31, 2014.</ref> The race essentially ended at that point, and Garrett won in a rout, 60% to 38% - even winning Roukema's former base in Bergen County.<ref>[http://www.jrn.columbia.edu/studentwork/election/2002/senate/republicans.asp In Jersey, Conservative and Moderate Republicans Vie for Control of Party], jrn/columbia/edu; accessed July 31, 2006.</ref><ref>{{cite book|page=1043|chapter=New Jersey 5th District|title=[[Almanac of American Politics]] 2004|authorlink1=Michael Barone (pundit)|first1=Michael|last1=Barone|authorlink2=Richard E.

Garrett was reelected in 2004 with 58% of the vote. He declined to debate his opponent [[Anne Wolfe]], several times, claiming to have conflicts with his schedule in [[Washington D.C.]] Eventually he debated her twice. In 2006, Garrett defeated his Republican primary rival, Michael J. Cino of Bergen County. In the [[New Jersey's 5th congressional district election, 2006|November 2006 election]], Garrett defeated [[Paul Aronsohn]], a former employee of the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] during the [[Clinton Administration]] and Independent R. Matthew Fretz to win a third term.  However, in this election, he only won 55% of the vote—the lowest percentage for a Republican in the district since it assumed its current configuration in 1983. The 2006 election was close enough to attract the attention of the [[Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee|DCCC]], who targeted the 5th District for a pickup in 2008. The [[Democratic Party (US)|Democratic Party]] nominated [[Dennis Shulman]], a highly respected [[rabbi]] and [[psychologist]], as their nominee in 2008. Garrett defeated Shulman 56%-42% in the [[United States House of Representatives elections in New Jersey, 2008|2008 general election]]. {{cn|date=November 2014}}

In 2010, Garrett defeated Tod Theise, receiving 65% of the vote. 

In 2014, Garrett faced Democratic nominee Roy Cho.<ref>[http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/08/at_unofficial_start_of_election_season_national_parties_are_focusing_on_1_nj_congressional_district.html#incart_river Garrett v Cho], nj.com; accessed October 31, 2014.</ref> The two largest newspapers in New Jersey both endorsed Cho. ''[[The Star-Ledger]]'' called Garrett "a retrograde culture warrior who wants to eliminate a woman’s right to choose", and criticized his support for [[Budget sequestration in 2013|the 2013 budget sequester]], which has been accused of hurting New Jersey; by contrast, Cho was called "a centrist who actually wants to govern."<ref>{{cite news|title=Roy Cho for Congress in the fifth district: Editorial|newspaper=[[The Star-Ledger]]|date=October 26, 2014|url=http://www.nj.com/opinion/index.ssf/2014/10/roy_cho_for_congress_in_the_fifth_district_editorial.html|accessdate=2014-10-27}}</ref> ''[[The Record (Bergen County)|The Bergen Record]]'' criticized Garrett as "a dogmatic conservative who believes ideology trumps compromise" and agreed with Cho's call for a federal role in improving the region's transportation infrastructure.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Record: Cho in the 5th District|newspaper=[[The Record (Bergen County)|The Bergen Record]]|date=October 26, 2014|url=http://www.northjersey.com/opinion/opinion-editorials/cho-in-the-5th-1.1118228#sthash.QID3Fo9p.dpuf|accessdate=2014-10-27}} </ref> Garrett won the midterm election.<ref>http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/04/scott-garrett-midterm-election-results_n_5917652.html</ref>

===Legislation===
On May 8, 2013, Garrett introduced the [[Budget and Accounting Transparency Act of 2014 (H.R. 1872; 113th Congress)]], a bill that would modify the budgetary treatment of federal credit programs.<ref name=1872cbo>{{cite web|title=H.R. 1872 - CBO|url=http://cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/hr1872.pdf|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=28 March 2014}}</ref> The bill would require that the cost of direct loans or loan guarantees be recognized in the federal budget on a fair-value basis using guidelines set forth by the [[Financial Accounting Standards Board]].<ref name="1872cbo"/> The bill would also require the federal budget to reflect the net impact of programs administered by [[Fannie Mae]] and [[Freddie Mac]].<ref name="1872cbo"/> The changes made by the bill would mean that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were counted on the budget instead of considered separately and would mean that the debt of those two programs would be included in the national debt.<ref name=Housepushbudgetreform>{{cite news|last=Kasperowicz|first=Pete|title=House to push budget reforms next week|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/economics-trade/202010-house-to-push-budget-reforms-next-week|accessdate=7 April 2014|newspaper=The Hill|date=28 March 2014}}</ref> These programs themselves would not be changed, but how they are accounted for in the [[United States federal budget]] would be. The goal of the bill is to improve the accuracy of how some programs are accounted for in the federal budget.<ref name=bringoutbudget>{{cite news|last=Kasperowicz|first=Pete|title=Next week: Bring out the budget|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/scheduling/202730-next-week-bring-out-the-budget|accessdate=7 April 2014|newspaper=The Hill|date=4 April 2014}}</ref>

==Political positions==
Although Garrett promoted himself as a "mainstream tax-cutter that [[George W. Bush|President Bush]] needs in Congress,"<ref>Archive of Garrett's campaign site at http://web.archive.org/web/20030425222436/http://garrettforcongress.com</ref> he broke with the Bush Administration several times.

He also serves on the [[Liberty Caucus]] (despite opposing the legalization of online poker), a group of [[Libertarianism|libertarian]]-minded congressmen.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.thelibertycommittee.org/|title= The Liberty Committee|accessdate=2007-06-24}}</ref> Other members include(ed) [[Ron Paul]] of [[Texas]], [[Jimmy Duncan (U.S. politician)|Jimmy Duncan]] of [[Tennessee]], [[Roscoe Bartlett]] of [[Maryland]], [[Walter B.

===Foreign policy===
In 2007, Garrett led nineteen US lawmakers to introduce a bill in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] backing [[United Nations member states|UN membership]] for [[Republic of China|Taiwan]], contrary to U.S. policy since [[Richard M. Nixon|Nixon]].<ref>[http://www.chinapost.com.tw/news/2007/11/11/130375/The-Ministry.htm The Ministry of Foreign Affairs welcomes legislation introduced by 19 lawmakers], ''[[The China Post]]'', November 11, 2007</ref> Garrett is a staunch supporter of military aid to Israel as well as sanctions against Iran.

In 2008, he opposed H.R. 5767, the Payment Systems Protection Act (a bill that sought to place a moratorium on enforcement of the [[Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act]] while the [[U.S. Treasury Department]] and the [[Federal Reserve]] defined "unlawful Internet gambling"). He was the only member of the New Jersey delegation to vote for [[Off shore oil drilling|oil and gas drilling off the shore]] of New Jersey.<ref>[http://www.nj.com/news/ledger/index.ssf?/base/news-7/1151647828208030.xml&coll=1&thispage=1 House votes to lift drilling ban for offshore natural gas and oil], ''[[Star-Ledger]]'', June 30, 2006</ref> Garrett was also the only member to vote against restrictions on "[[price gouging]]" by [[oil companies]],<ref>[http://www.northjersey.com/page.php?qstr=eXJpcnk3ZjcxN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXkyJmZnYmVsN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXk2OTMwMzMy "Garrett hit for vote against gas price-gouging ban"], ''[[The Record (Bergen County)]]'', May 6, 2006.</ref> to vote against [[child safety lock]]s on handguns, and to vote against emergency funding for [[Hurricane Katrina]] victims.<ref>[http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2005/roll460.xml Roll Call: Further Emergency Supplemental Appropriations, Hurricane Katrina, 2005], September 8, 2005</ref> He was the only New Jersey member to vote against federal aid for [[Pet|household pets]] in case of a disaster.<ref>[http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2006/roll178.xml Roll Call: Pets Evacuation and Transportation Standards Act], May 22, 2006</ref> He was one of only four members of the House of Representatives to vote against an extension of [[unemployment benefits]].<ref>[http://www.komotv.com/news/story.asp?ID=22346 Bush Signs Extension of Federal Unemployment Benefits], [[KOMO-TV]], January 8, 2003</ref>

In July 2007, Congressman Garrett proposed an amendment to strike money in a spending bill for native [[Alaska]]n and [[Hawaii]]an educational programs.<ref name="young">[http://www.politico.com/blogs/thecrypt/0707/North_to_Alaska.html North to Alaska], ''The Politico'' dated July 17, 2007.</ref> Congressman [[Don Young]] of Alaska defended the funds on the floor of the House, saying, "You want my money, my money."<ref name="young"/> Young went on to suggest that conservative Republicans such as Garrett lost the Republicans their majority in the 2006 election by challenging spending [[earmarks]]{{disambiguation needed|date=September 2012}}, and made several critical remarks about the state of New Jersey.<ref name="young"/> While Garrett did not ask for an official reprimand, other conservative Republicans took exception to Young's remarks that the funds in question represented his money. Members of the [[Republican Study Committee]] gave Garrett a standing ovation later in the day during the group's weekly meeting.<ref name="young"/>

====Suffrage====
Garrett was the only congressman from New Jersey to vote against the reauthorization of the [[Voting Rights Act]] for purposes of [[states' rights]].<ref name=Record>[http://www.bergen.com/page.php?qstr=eXJpcnk3ZjcxN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXkxNCZmZ2JlbDdmN3ZxZWVFRXl5Njk2Mjg5NQ== The unending struggle for voting rights], ''[[The Record (Bergen County)]]'', July 18, 2006 {{Dead link|date=December 2009}}</ref>

===Other===
Garrett led a drive to demand the immediate resignation of Governor [[Jim McGreevey]] after he admitted to an [[adultery|extramarital affair]] with a male state employee. McGreevey announced that he would stay in office until November 15, 2004. Had McGreevey resigned before September 8, 2004, there would have been a special election at the same time as that year's presidential election. Garrett started a petition on his campaign web site demanding a special election.  According to his campaign manager, it received 10,000 responses.

In November 2009, Garrett met at the [[United States Capitol]] with protesting [[Tea Party protests|"tea party"]] constituents.  After [[birther]]s harangued him for several minutes, he agreed  President [[Barack Obama]] should produce an original [[birth certificate]] to verify his eligibility to be [[President of the United States]].<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baVFhC-_oKM Video: No Obama Birth Certificate 11/5/09 Scott Garrett DC House Call], [[NJCommonSense]], November 5, 2009</ref><ref>{{cite web

==Political campaigns==
{{BLP sources section|  date=October 2013}}
Garrett ran for Congress unsuccessfully against incumbent Congresswoman [[Marge Roukema]] in the 1998 and 2000 Republican primaries, falling short both times with 48% of the vote.<ref>[http://www.naco.org/cnews/2001/01-11-26/roukema.htm Roukema retires], ''County News Online'', November 26, 2001</ref> He received support from several groups who had long felt chagrin at Roukema's moderate voting record; Garrett had by this time established himself as one of the most [[conservatism in the United States|conservative]] members of the General Assembly.

In 2002, Roukema opted not to run for a 12th term. Garrett won a contested five-way primary with 45% of the vote over State Assemblyman [[David C. Russo]] (26%) and [[New Jersey Senate|State Senator]] [[Gerald Cardinale]] (25%), who had received Roukema's endorsement.<ref>Kocieniewski, David. [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9402E5D91E3AF936A35755C0A9649C8B63&scp=1&sq=garrett+russo+roukema&st=nyt "Forrester to Represent G.O.P. in Race to Unseat Torricelli"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', June 5, 2002. Accessed March 30, 2008. "In the Republican primary to replace Representative Marge Roukema, who is retiring from her Fifth Congressional District seat, State Assemblyman E. Scott Garrett, defeated State Senator Gerald Cardinale, whom Mrs. Roukema had endorsed. With all precincts reporting, Mr. Garrett had 46 percent, to 25 percent for Mr. Cardinale and 26 percent for Assemblyman David C. Russo."</ref><ref>[http://www.voterzview.com/Weekly/38_070502.htm Barnes Pleads Guilty, Primaries, & Georgia Scott; 38th Column] dated July 5, 2002</ref>

In the 2002 general election, Garrett faced [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidate Anne Sumers, an [[ophthalmologist]] and former Republican. Roukema did not endorse Garrett in the general election. Roukema did not endorse Sumers either, even though part of Sumers' strategy was to portray herself as a "Roukema Republican" and win support in Roukema's old [[Bergen County]] base (Bergen County is the biggest county in the 5th district). Sumers' chances decreased significantly after she made several ill-advised comments about the U.S.-[[Taliban]] conflict on an Internet message board.<ref>[http://www.csmonitor.com/2002/0705/p02s01-uspo.html Patriotism becomes nasty campaign issue], csmonitor.com, July 5, 2002; accessed October 31, 2014.</ref> The race essentially ended at that point, and Garrett won in a rout, 60% to 38% - even winning Roukema's former base in Bergen County.<ref>[http://www.jrn.columbia.edu/studentwork/election/2002/senate/republicans.asp In Jersey, Conservative and Moderate Republicans Vie for Control of Party], jrn/columbia/edu; accessed July 31, 2006.</ref><ref>{{cite book|page=1043|chapter=New Jersey 5th District|title=[[Almanac of American Politics]] 2004|authorlink1=Michael Barone (pundit)|first1=Michael|last1=Barone|authorlink2=Richard E.

Garrett was reelected in 2004 with 58% of the vote. He declined to debate his opponent [[Anne Wolfe]], several times, claiming to have conflicts with his schedule in [[Washington D.C.]] Eventually he debated her twice. In 2006, Garrett defeated his Republican primary rival, Michael J. Cino of Bergen County. In the [[New Jersey's 5th congressional district election, 2006|November 2006 election]], Garrett defeated [[Paul Aronsohn]], a former employee of the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] during the [[Clinton Administration]] and Independent R. Matthew Fretz to win a third term.  However, in this election, he only won 55% of the vote—the lowest percentage for a Republican in the district since it assumed its current configuration in 1983. The 2006 election was close enough to attract the attention of the [[Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee|DCCC]], who targeted the 5th District for a pickup in 2008. The [[Democratic Party (US)|Democratic Party]] nominated [[Dennis Shulman]], a highly respected [[rabbi]] and [[psychologist]], as their nominee in 2008. Garrett defeated Shulman 56%-42% in the [[United States House of Representatives elections in New Jersey, 2008|2008 general election]]. {{cn|date=November 2014}}

In 2010, Garrett defeated Tod Theise, receiving 65% of the vote. 

In 2014, Garrett faced Democratic nominee Roy Cho.<ref>[http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/08/at_unofficial_start_of_election_season_national_parties_are_focusing_on_1_nj_congressional_district.html#incart_river Garrett v Cho], nj.com; accessed October 31, 2014.</ref> The two largest newspapers in New Jersey both endorsed Cho. ''[[The Star-Ledger]]'' called Garrett "a retrograde culture warrior who wants to eliminate a woman’s right to choose", and criticized his support for [[Budget sequestration in 2013|the 2013 budget sequester]], which has been accused of hurting New Jersey; by contrast, Cho was called "a centrist who actually wants to govern."<ref>{{cite news|title=Roy Cho for Congress in the fifth district: Editorial|newspaper=[[The Star-Ledger]]|date=October 26, 2014|url=http://www.nj.com/opinion/index.ssf/2014/10/roy_cho_for_congress_in_the_fifth_district_editorial.html|accessdate=2014-10-27}}</ref> ''[[The Record (Bergen County)|The Bergen Record]]'' criticized Garrett as "a dogmatic conservative who believes ideology trumps compromise" and agreed with Cho's call for a federal role in improving the region's transportation infrastructure.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Record: Cho in the 5th District|newspaper=[[The Record (Bergen County)|The Bergen Record]]|date=October 26, 2014|url=http://www.northjersey.com/opinion/opinion-editorials/cho-in-the-5th-1.1118228#sthash.QID3Fo9p.dpuf|accessdate=2014-10-27}} </ref> Garrett won the midterm election.<ref>http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/04/scott-garrett-midterm-election-results_n_5917652.html</ref>
