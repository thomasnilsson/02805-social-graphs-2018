==Military career==
McSally earned her wings following graduation from Undergraduate Pilot Training at [[Laughlin AFB]], Texas and was initially assigned to Laughlin as a First Assignment Instructor Pilot (FAIP) in the [[T-37 Tweet|T-37]] jet trainer. Following the repeal of the combat aircraft restriction for female pilots, McSally became the first woman in U.S. history to fly a combat aircraft into enemy territory when she flew into Iraq in support of the United Nations no-fly zone enforcement.<ref name="people"/> She completed Lead-in Fighter Training (LIFT) in 1993.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tucsonweekly.com/TheRange/archives/2012/02/03/cd8-special-election-whos-martha-mcsally-and-why-are-people-saying-she-might-run-for-congress|title=CD8 Special Election: Who's Martha McSally and Why Are People Saying She Might Run for Congress?|date=February 3, 2012|accessdate=November 12, 2014|website=CD8 Special Election: Who's Martha McSally and Why Are People Saying She Might Run for Congress?|publisher=Tucson Weekly|last=Nintzel|first=Jim}}</ref>

McSally completed Replacement Training Unit for the [[A-10 Thunderbolt II]] at [[Davis-Monthan AFB|Davis-Monthan AFB, Arizona]], and was assigned to an operational A-10 squadron and was deployed to [[Kuwait]] in January 1995.<ref name=":0"/> During that deployment, she flew combat patrols over [[Iraq]] in support of [[Operation Southern Watch]], enforcing the [[no-fly zone]] over southern Iraq.<ref name=":0"/> In 1999, she deployed to Europe in support of [[Operation Allied Force]]. McSally was selected as one of seven active duty Air Force officers for the Legislative Fellowship program, during which time she lived in Washington, D.C. and advised [[John Kyl]] on defense and foreign affairs policy.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://mcsallyforcongress.com/about-martha|title=About Martha|accessdate=November 12, 2014|website=About Martha|publisher=mcsallyforcongress}}</ref>

Promoted to [[Major (United States)|Major]], she reported to Joint Task Force Southwest Asia (JTF-SWA) in [[Riyadh, Saudi Arabia]] in 2000 for a temporary assignment in support of Operation Southern Watch. Promoted below the zone to [[Lieutenant Colonel]], she took command of the A-10 equipped [[354th Fighter Squadron]] at [[Davis-Monthan AFB]] in July 2004, and was subsequently deployed to [[Afghanistan]] under [[Operation Enduring Freedom]], where she employed weapons loaded on her A-10 in combat for the first time. In 2005, McSally and her squadron were awarded the David C. Shilling Award, given by the [[Air Force Association]] for the best aerospace contribution to national defense.<ref name=":1"/>

===Lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Defense (''McSally vs. Rumsfeld'')===
McSally was represented by the [[Rutherford Institute]] in a successful 2001 lawsuit against the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], challenging the military policy that required U.S. and U.K. servicewomen stationed in [[Saudi Arabia]] to wear the body-covering [[abaya]] when traveling off base in the country.<ref name=Vojdik>Valorie Vojdik, [http://www.law.duke.edu/shell/cite.pl?9+Duke+J.+Gender+L.+&+Pol%27y+261 "The Invisibility of Gender in War"], ''Duke Journal of Gender Law and Policy'', 9 (261), 2002.</ref><ref>John E. Mulligan, "Female pilot sues US, alleging bias", ''Providence Journal Bulletin'', December 5, 2001, p. A01</ref> At the time of the lawsuit McSally, as a [[Major]] (O-4), was the highest ranking female fighter pilot in the U.S. Air Force. Her suit alleged "the regulations required her to send the message that she believes women are subservient to men."<ref name="now">{{cite news|last=Keller|first=Michele|title=Female Fighter Pilot Battles U.S. Military's Double-Standard in Saudi Arabia|url=http://www.now.org/nnt/spring-2002/mcsally.html|accessdate=July 16, 2011|newspaper=National NOW Times|date=Spring 2002}}</ref> In addition to the issue of religious garb, McSally noted that policies also included other requirements:<blockquote>In a "60 Minutes" interview broadcast on CBS on January 20, 2002, she described the discrimination she experienced under the policy: "I have to sit in the back and at all times I must be escorted by a male ... [who], when questioned, is supposed to claim me as his wife," she said. "I can fly a single-seat aircraft in enemy territory, but [in Saudi Arabia] I can't drive a vehicle."<ref name="now"/></blockquote>

During this process, she was granted audience with several high level officials, including two Secretaries of Defense, [[William Cohen]] and [[Donald Rumsfeld]], which was atypical of a service member of her comparatively junior rank and position, especially in light of her public protest. General [[Tommy Franks]], then commander of the [[United States Central Command]] (USCENTCOM), announced in 2002 that U.S. military servicewomen would no longer be required to wear the abaya, although they would be "encouraged" to do so as a show of respect for local customs. Commenting on the change, Central Command spokesman, Colonel Rick Thomas, said it was not made because of McSally's lawsuit, but had already been "under review" before the lawsuit was filed. News reports noted that McSally had been fighting for a change in the policy for seven years, and had filed the lawsuit after she had been threatened with a [[court martial]] if she did not comply and wear the abaya.<ref name="relents">{{cite news|last=Russell|first=Jan Jarboe|title=Pentagon relents on Arabic dress policy for women|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/local/opinion/article/Pentagon-relents-on-Arabic-dress-policy-for-women-1078347.php|accessdate=July 16, 2011|newspaper=Seattle Post-Intelligencer|date=January 24, 2002}}</ref> Critics of the policy noted that while female military personnel had been required to wear the abaya, the situation was not the same for "women diplomats" of the [[U.S. Department of State]] assigned to the U.S. Embassy in [[Riyadh]], who were actually encouraged ''not'' to wear the abaya when they were involved in official business, "...because they are representing the United States." Embassy officials stated that, "...in their personal time, embassy employees can choose how to dress." According to these U.S. officials, "...the Saudi government does not require non-Muslim women to wear a dark robe known as an abaya.... The official guidance, issued by the Saudi Embassy in Washington, says that foreigners should dress conservatively but they are not required to wear the robe."<ref>{{cite news|last=Pound|first=Edward T.|title=Saudi rule looser than Pentagon's|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2001-04-24-mcsally.htm|accessdate=July 18, 2011|newspaper=USA Today|date=April 24, 2001}}</ref>

Eventually the U.S. Congress "approved legislation that prohibited anyone in the military from requiring or encouraging servicewomen to put on abayas in Saudi Arabia or to use taxpayers’ money to buy them."<ref name="hijab">{{cite web|last=De Wind|first=Dorian|title=Should our Servicewomen in Afghanistan Have to Wear Headscarves?|url=http://themoderatevoice.com/102140/should-our-servicewomen-in-afghanistan-have-to-wear-headscarves|publisher=The Moderate Voice|accessdate=July 16, 2011|date=February 21, 2011}}</ref>

==U.S. House campaigns==

{{Main|Arizona's 8th congressional district special election, 2012|United States House of Representatives elections in Arizona, 2012#District 2}}
On February 9, 2012, McSally announced her candidacy for the special election for [[Arizona's 8th congressional district]] vacancy created by the resignation of [[Gabrielle Giffords]]. She was an unsuccessful candidate in the Republican nomination for the special election, losing to Republican nominee Jesse Kelly.<ref name=milcom20120209>{{cite news|last=McCombs|first=Brady|title=1st Female AF Air Combat Vet in Run for Congress|url=http://www.military.com/news/article/1st-female-af-air-combat-vet-in-run-for-congress.html|accessdate=February 10, 2012|newspaper=[[Arizona Daily Star]]|date=February 9, 2012}}</ref>

McSally then ran for and won the Republican nomination in the regular election for the district, which had been renumbered as the [[Arizona's 2nd congressional district|2nd District]]. She faced incumbent Democrat [[Ron Barber]] and Libertarian nominee Anthony Powell in the November 2012 election.<ref>{{cite news|title=Former Giffords aide beats back primary challenge|url=http://www.abc15.com/dpp/news/state/former-giffords-aide-beats-back-primary-challenge|newspaper=[[KNXV-TV]]|agency=Associated Press|date=August 29, 2012}}</ref> She was endorsed by the [[National Federation of Independent Businesses]], [[United States Chamber of Commerce]], National Association of Wholesalers, of Commerce, National Association of Home Builders and Associated Builders and Contractors.<ref>{{cite news|last=McSally|first=Martha|title=My commitment: Solutions to get people working again|url=http://www.insidetucsonbusiness.com/opinion/columnists/guest_opinion/my-commitment-solutions-to-get-people-working-again/article_7dcfdfee-1964-11e2-a253-0019bb2963f4.html|accessdate=November 4, 2012|newspaper=Inside Tucson Business|date=October 19, 2012}}</ref>

The race was one of the closest in the nation. McSally led on election night by a few hundred votes, but the race was deemed too close to call due to a large number of provisional ballots.  Barber eventually overtook McSally as more ballots were counted.  By November 16, most of the outstanding ballots were in heavily Democratic precincts near Tucson. ''[[The Arizona Republic]]'' determined that as a result, McSally would not be able to pick up enough votes to overcome Barber's lead.<ref name=ArizonaRepublic>Nowicki, Dan and Jon D'Anna, [http://www.azcentral.com/news/politics/articles/20121116barber-wins-race-mcsally-arizona-district-2.html "Barber wins hard-fought race against McSally"], ''[[The Arizona Republic]]'', November 17, 2012.</ref> By November 17, Barber's lead over McSally had grown to 1,400 votes. That day, the [[Associated Press]] determined that there weren't enough ballots outstanding for McSally to regain the lead, and called the race for Barber.<ref>[http://www.tucsonnewsnow.com/story/20125699/ap "Voters in Arizona's 2nd pick Barber over McSally"], [[Associated Press]] via [[KOLD-TV]], November 17, 2012.</ref> She conceded the race later that morning.<ref name=ArizonaRepublic/>

McSally later declared her intention of running for the same seat in 2014. She won the June 3 primary against 2 other Republican opponents, taking nearly 70% of the vote.<ref name="azsos.gov">[http://www.azsos.gov/election/2012/special/primary/Canvass2012SpecialPrimary.pdf 2014 Arizona's 2nd District Republican primary results], azsos.gov, June 3, 2014; accessed November 8, 2014.</ref> In the November 4 general election, the race was too close to call by the end of election night, and eventually went on to be the final federal election of the 2014 cycle to be decided. With 100% of the votes counted, McSally had a 161 vote lead and declared victory on November 12, 2014, but due to the fact that the margin of victory was less than 1%, an automatic recount was called on December 1.<ref>[http://www.jrn.com/kgun9/news/Recount-next-in-Barber-McSally-race-282507511.html Recount in Barber-McSally race due to 161 margin of victory for McSally], jrn.com; accessed November 14, 2014.</ref> On December 17, the official recount declared McSally the winner by 167 votes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.azpm.org/p/frontpage-electionnews/2014/12/17/52739-will-it-be-congresswoman-elect-mcsally-or-2nd-term-for-barber/|title=McSally Wins Congressional Seat, Ousting Barber|publisher=}}</ref> When she takes office on January 3, 2015; she will be only the second Republican ever to represent a [[southern Arizona]]-based district in the U.S. House of Representatives; the first was [[Jim Kolbe]], who represented what is now the 2nd from 1985 to 2007.

==Military career==
McSally earned her wings following graduation from Undergraduate Pilot Training at [[Laughlin AFB]], Texas and was initially assigned to Laughlin as a First Assignment Instructor Pilot (FAIP) in the [[T-37 Tweet|T-37]] jet trainer. Following the repeal of the combat aircraft restriction for female pilots, McSally became the first woman in U.S. history to fly a combat aircraft into enemy territory when she flew into Iraq in support of the United Nations no-fly zone enforcement.<ref name="people"/> She completed Lead-in Fighter Training (LIFT) in 1993.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tucsonweekly.com/TheRange/archives/2012/02/03/cd8-special-election-whos-martha-mcsally-and-why-are-people-saying-she-might-run-for-congress|title=CD8 Special Election: Who's Martha McSally and Why Are People Saying She Might Run for Congress?|date=February 3, 2012|accessdate=November 12, 2014|website=CD8 Special Election: Who's Martha McSally and Why Are People Saying She Might Run for Congress?|publisher=Tucson Weekly|last=Nintzel|first=Jim}}</ref>

McSally completed Replacement Training Unit for the [[A-10 Thunderbolt II]] at [[Davis-Monthan AFB|Davis-Monthan AFB, Arizona]], and was assigned to an operational A-10 squadron and was deployed to [[Kuwait]] in January 1995.<ref name=":0"/> During that deployment, she flew combat patrols over [[Iraq]] in support of [[Operation Southern Watch]], enforcing the [[no-fly zone]] over southern Iraq.<ref name=":0"/> In 1999, she deployed to Europe in support of [[Operation Allied Force]]. McSally was selected as one of seven active duty Air Force officers for the Legislative Fellowship program, during which time she lived in Washington, D.C. and advised [[John Kyl]] on defense and foreign affairs policy.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://mcsallyforcongress.com/about-martha|title=About Martha|accessdate=November 12, 2014|website=About Martha|publisher=mcsallyforcongress}}</ref>

Promoted to [[Major (United States)|Major]], she reported to Joint Task Force Southwest Asia (JTF-SWA) in [[Riyadh, Saudi Arabia]] in 2000 for a temporary assignment in support of Operation Southern Watch. Promoted below the zone to [[Lieutenant Colonel]], she took command of the A-10 equipped [[354th Fighter Squadron]] at [[Davis-Monthan AFB]] in July 2004, and was subsequently deployed to [[Afghanistan]] under [[Operation Enduring Freedom]], where she employed weapons loaded on her A-10 in combat for the first time. In 2005, McSally and her squadron were awarded the David C. Shilling Award, given by the [[Air Force Association]] for the best aerospace contribution to national defense.<ref name=":1"/>

===Lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Defense (''McSally vs. Rumsfeld'')===
McSally was represented by the [[Rutherford Institute]] in a successful 2001 lawsuit against the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], challenging the military policy that required U.S. and U.K. servicewomen stationed in [[Saudi Arabia]] to wear the body-covering [[abaya]] when traveling off base in the country.<ref name=Vojdik>Valorie Vojdik, [http://www.law.duke.edu/shell/cite.pl?9+Duke+J.+Gender+L.+&+Pol%27y+261 "The Invisibility of Gender in War"], ''Duke Journal of Gender Law and Policy'', 9 (261), 2002.</ref><ref>John E. Mulligan, "Female pilot sues US, alleging bias", ''Providence Journal Bulletin'', December 5, 2001, p. A01</ref> At the time of the lawsuit McSally, as a [[Major]] (O-4), was the highest ranking female fighter pilot in the U.S. Air Force. Her suit alleged "the regulations required her to send the message that she believes women are subservient to men."<ref name="now">{{cite news|last=Keller|first=Michele|title=Female Fighter Pilot Battles U.S. Military's Double-Standard in Saudi Arabia|url=http://www.now.org/nnt/spring-2002/mcsally.html|accessdate=July 16, 2011|newspaper=National NOW Times|date=Spring 2002}}</ref> In addition to the issue of religious garb, McSally noted that policies also included other requirements:<blockquote>In a "60 Minutes" interview broadcast on CBS on January 20, 2002, she described the discrimination she experienced under the policy: "I have to sit in the back and at all times I must be escorted by a male ... [who], when questioned, is supposed to claim me as his wife," she said. "I can fly a single-seat aircraft in enemy territory, but [in Saudi Arabia] I can't drive a vehicle."<ref name="now"/></blockquote>

During this process, she was granted audience with several high level officials, including two Secretaries of Defense, [[William Cohen]] and [[Donald Rumsfeld]], which was atypical of a service member of her comparatively junior rank and position, especially in light of her public protest. General [[Tommy Franks]], then commander of the [[United States Central Command]] (USCENTCOM), announced in 2002 that U.S. military servicewomen would no longer be required to wear the abaya, although they would be "encouraged" to do so as a show of respect for local customs. Commenting on the change, Central Command spokesman, Colonel Rick Thomas, said it was not made because of McSally's lawsuit, but had already been "under review" before the lawsuit was filed. News reports noted that McSally had been fighting for a change in the policy for seven years, and had filed the lawsuit after she had been threatened with a [[court martial]] if she did not comply and wear the abaya.<ref name="relents">{{cite news|last=Russell|first=Jan Jarboe|title=Pentagon relents on Arabic dress policy for women|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/local/opinion/article/Pentagon-relents-on-Arabic-dress-policy-for-women-1078347.php|accessdate=July 16, 2011|newspaper=Seattle Post-Intelligencer|date=January 24, 2002}}</ref> Critics of the policy noted that while female military personnel had been required to wear the abaya, the situation was not the same for "women diplomats" of the [[U.S. Department of State]] assigned to the U.S. Embassy in [[Riyadh]], who were actually encouraged ''not'' to wear the abaya when they were involved in official business, "...because they are representing the United States." Embassy officials stated that, "...in their personal time, embassy employees can choose how to dress." According to these U.S. officials, "...the Saudi government does not require non-Muslim women to wear a dark robe known as an abaya.... The official guidance, issued by the Saudi Embassy in Washington, says that foreigners should dress conservatively but they are not required to wear the robe."<ref>{{cite news|last=Pound|first=Edward T.|title=Saudi rule looser than Pentagon's|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2001-04-24-mcsally.htm|accessdate=July 18, 2011|newspaper=USA Today|date=April 24, 2001}}</ref>

Eventually the U.S. Congress "approved legislation that prohibited anyone in the military from requiring or encouraging servicewomen to put on abayas in Saudi Arabia or to use taxpayers’ money to buy them."<ref name="hijab">{{cite web|last=De Wind|first=Dorian|title=Should our Servicewomen in Afghanistan Have to Wear Headscarves?|url=http://themoderatevoice.com/102140/should-our-servicewomen-in-afghanistan-have-to-wear-headscarves|publisher=The Moderate Voice|accessdate=July 16, 2011|date=February 21, 2011}}</ref>

==U.S. House campaigns==

{{Main|Arizona's 8th congressional district special election, 2012|United States House of Representatives elections in Arizona, 2012#District 2}}
On February 9, 2012, McSally announced her candidacy for the special election for [[Arizona's 8th congressional district]] vacancy created by the resignation of [[Gabrielle Giffords]]. She was an unsuccessful candidate in the Republican nomination for the special election, losing to Republican nominee Jesse Kelly.<ref name=milcom20120209>{{cite news|last=McCombs|first=Brady|title=1st Female AF Air Combat Vet in Run for Congress|url=http://www.military.com/news/article/1st-female-af-air-combat-vet-in-run-for-congress.html|accessdate=February 10, 2012|newspaper=[[Arizona Daily Star]]|date=February 9, 2012}}</ref>

McSally then ran for and won the Republican nomination in the regular election for the district, which had been renumbered as the [[Arizona's 2nd congressional district|2nd District]]. She faced incumbent Democrat [[Ron Barber]] and Libertarian nominee Anthony Powell in the November 2012 election.<ref>{{cite news|title=Former Giffords aide beats back primary challenge|url=http://www.abc15.com/dpp/news/state/former-giffords-aide-beats-back-primary-challenge|newspaper=[[KNXV-TV]]|agency=Associated Press|date=August 29, 2012}}</ref> She was endorsed by the [[National Federation of Independent Businesses]], [[United States Chamber of Commerce]], National Association of Wholesalers, of Commerce, National Association of Home Builders and Associated Builders and Contractors.<ref>{{cite news|last=McSally|first=Martha|title=My commitment: Solutions to get people working again|url=http://www.insidetucsonbusiness.com/opinion/columnists/guest_opinion/my-commitment-solutions-to-get-people-working-again/article_7dcfdfee-1964-11e2-a253-0019bb2963f4.html|accessdate=November 4, 2012|newspaper=Inside Tucson Business|date=October 19, 2012}}</ref>

The race was one of the closest in the nation. McSally led on election night by a few hundred votes, but the race was deemed too close to call due to a large number of provisional ballots.  Barber eventually overtook McSally as more ballots were counted.  By November 16, most of the outstanding ballots were in heavily Democratic precincts near Tucson. ''[[The Arizona Republic]]'' determined that as a result, McSally would not be able to pick up enough votes to overcome Barber's lead.<ref name=ArizonaRepublic>Nowicki, Dan and Jon D'Anna, [http://www.azcentral.com/news/politics/articles/20121116barber-wins-race-mcsally-arizona-district-2.html "Barber wins hard-fought race against McSally"], ''[[The Arizona Republic]]'', November 17, 2012.</ref> By November 17, Barber's lead over McSally had grown to 1,400 votes. That day, the [[Associated Press]] determined that there weren't enough ballots outstanding for McSally to regain the lead, and called the race for Barber.<ref>[http://www.tucsonnewsnow.com/story/20125699/ap "Voters in Arizona's 2nd pick Barber over McSally"], [[Associated Press]] via [[KOLD-TV]], November 17, 2012.</ref> She conceded the race later that morning.<ref name=ArizonaRepublic/>

McSally later declared her intention of running for the same seat in 2014. She won the June 3 primary against 2 other Republican opponents, taking nearly 70% of the vote.<ref name="azsos.gov">[http://www.azsos.gov/election/2012/special/primary/Canvass2012SpecialPrimary.pdf 2014 Arizona's 2nd District Republican primary results], azsos.gov, June 3, 2014; accessed November 8, 2014.</ref> In the November 4 general election, the race was too close to call by the end of election night, and eventually went on to be the final federal election of the 2014 cycle to be decided. With 100% of the votes counted, McSally had a 161 vote lead and declared victory on November 12, 2014, but due to the fact that the margin of victory was less than 1%, an automatic recount was called on December 1.<ref>[http://www.jrn.com/kgun9/news/Recount-next-in-Barber-McSally-race-282507511.html Recount in Barber-McSally race due to 161 margin of victory for McSally], jrn.com; accessed November 14, 2014.</ref> On December 17, the official recount declared McSally the winner by 167 votes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.azpm.org/p/frontpage-electionnews/2014/12/17/52739-will-it-be-congresswoman-elect-mcsally-or-2nd-term-for-barber/|title=McSally Wins Congressional Seat, Ousting Barber|publisher=}}</ref> When she takes office on January 3, 2015; she will be only the second Republican ever to represent a [[southern Arizona]]-based district in the U.S. House of Representatives; the first was [[Jim Kolbe]], who represented what is now the 2nd from 1985 to 2007.
