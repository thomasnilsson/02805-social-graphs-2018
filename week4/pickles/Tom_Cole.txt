'''Thomas Jeffery "Tom" Cole''' (born April 28, 1949) is the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|OK|4}}, serving since 2003. He is a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. He is a Deputy [[Party whips of the United States House of Representatives|Majority Whip]]. The chairman of the [[National Republican Congressional Committee]] (NRCC) from 2006 to 2008, he was, during his tenure, the fourth-ranking [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] leader in the House. As of 2012, Cole – a member of the [[Chickasaw]] Nation – is one of only two registered [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] in Congress (the other being fellow Oklahoman [[Markwayne Mullin]]).

==Early life, education, and educating career==
Cole was born in [[Shreveport, Louisiana]], the son of Helen Te Ata (née Gale) and John D. Cole.<ref>http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~battle/reps/cole.htm</ref> He is a fifth-generation Oklahoman, having been raised in [[Moore, Oklahoma]]. He graduated from [[Grinnell College]] in 1971 with a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in [[history]]. His postgraduate degrees include an [[Master of Arts (postgraduate)|M.A.]] from [[Yale University]] (1974) and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] from the [[University of Oklahoma]] (1984), both in [[British history]]. Cole did research abroad as a [[Thomas J. Watson Fellow]] and was a [[Fulbright Fellow]] (1977–78) at the [[University of London]]. He was a college professor in history and politics before becoming a politician.

==Early political career==
Following his mother Helen, who served as a state representative and senator, Cole served in the [[Oklahoma Senate]] from 1988 to 1991, resigning mid-term to accept a job in Washington. From 1995 to 1999, he was Oklahoma's [[Secretary of State of Oklahoma|Secretary of State]] under Governor [[Frank Keating]], and assisted with the recovery efforts following the 1995 [[Oklahoma City bombing]]. He has also served as Chairman of the [[Oklahoma Republican Party]].

Cole has been heavily involved in national politics as well, having served both as Executive Director of the NRCC and as Chief of Staff of the [[Republican National Committee]] (RNC).

Cole spent two years working as a paid consultant for the [[United States Chamber of Commerce]], but his primary involvement in politics was as a [[political consultant]] for candidates. Along with partners Sharon Hargrave Caldwell and Deby Snodgrass, his firm (Cole, Hargrave, Snodgrass and Associates) played a large part in the reconstruction of Oklahoma's political landscape, and backed a number of candidates that took office during the [[Republican Revolution]] of 1994. Among their clients have been Keating, [[J.C. Watts]], [[Tom Coburn]], [[Frank Lucas (politician)|Frank Lucas]], [[Mary Fallin]], [[Wes Watkins]], [[Steve Largent]], former Mississippi congressman [[Chip Pickering]], and Hawaii governor [[Linda Lingle]].

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Elections===
During his initial campaign for the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] in 2002, Cole received the endorsement of Watts, the popular outgoing congressman. This helped him win a hard-fought general election over Democratic nominee and former Oklahoma State Senator Darryl Roberts. Cole subsequently won easy re-election campaigns in 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010, and 2012.

===Tenure===
Following the 2006 election cycle, the members of the House Republican Conference elected Cole to the post of NRCC Chairman, placing him in charge of national efforts to assist Republican candidates for Congress.

His voting record during his nine years in the House marks Cole as a solid conservative with occasional libertarian sympathies. He has consistently voted pro-life and pro-business positions, and established himself as a supporter of free trade, gun rights, the military, veterans, and American Indian issues. He favors loosening immigration restrictions and imposing stricter limits on campaign funds.  In 2012, he sponsored H.R. 5912 which would prohibit public funds from being used for political party conventions.  The legislations passed the House in September but awaits action by the Senate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/hr5912 |title=H.R. 5912: To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to prohibit the use of public funds for political party conventions |accessdate=12 October 2012}}</ref>

Cole has consistently voted against positions supported by lobbies for senior citizens, labor unions, and teachers' unions. However, he was critical in brokering protections for [[United States Department of Defense|DOD]] civilian workers.[http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/members/c001053/]

In June 2013, after another failure of the [[United States farm bill]] in Congress, Cole called the failure of the legislation inexcusable. His district in [[Oklahoma]] includes some of the state’s [[Agriculture|farming]] communities, and if the Farm Bill passed, it would have saved $40 billion over a ten-year period.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://newsok.com/oklahoma-reps.-tom-cole-jim-bridenstine-disagree-on-farm-bill/article/3854974 |title=Oklahoma Reps.

As Chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on the Legislative Branch, Cole was responsible for introducing the [[Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 2015 (H.R. 4487; 113th Congress)]].<ref name=4487allactions>{{cite web|title=H.R. 4487 - All Actions|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/4487/all-actions/|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=2 May 2014}}</ref> The bill would appropriate $3.3 billion to the legislative branch for FY 2015, which is approximately the same amount it received in FY 2014.<ref name=nextweek25ap>{{cite news|last=Marcos|first=Cristina|title=Next week:Appropriations season begins|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/scheduling/204424-next-week-appropriations-season-begins|accessdate=1 May 2014|newspaper=The Hill|date=25 April 2014}}</ref> According to  Cole, the bill meets its goals "in both an effective and efficient manner, and has done so in a genuinely bipartisan, inclusive and deliberative fashion."<ref name=RCHess2Ap>{{cite news|last=Hess|first=Hannah|title=Legislative Branch Bill Keeps House Spending in Check|url=http://www.rollcall.com/news/legislative_branch_bill_keeps_house_spending_in_check-231875-1.html|accessdate=14 May 2014|newspaper=Roll Call|date=2 April 2014}}</ref>

'''Thomas Jeffery "Tom" Cole''' (born April 28, 1949) is the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|OK|4}}, serving since 2003. He is a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. He is a Deputy [[Party whips of the United States House of Representatives|Majority Whip]]. The chairman of the [[National Republican Congressional Committee]] (NRCC) from 2006 to 2008, he was, during his tenure, the fourth-ranking [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] leader in the House. As of 2012, Cole – a member of the [[Chickasaw]] Nation – is one of only two registered [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] in Congress (the other being fellow Oklahoman [[Markwayne Mullin]]).

==Early life, education, and educating career==
Cole was born in [[Shreveport, Louisiana]], the son of Helen Te Ata (née Gale) and John D. Cole.<ref>http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~battle/reps/cole.htm</ref> He is a fifth-generation Oklahoman, having been raised in [[Moore, Oklahoma]]. He graduated from [[Grinnell College]] in 1971 with a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in [[history]]. His postgraduate degrees include an [[Master of Arts (postgraduate)|M.A.]] from [[Yale University]] (1974) and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] from the [[University of Oklahoma]] (1984), both in [[British history]]. Cole did research abroad as a [[Thomas J. Watson Fellow]] and was a [[Fulbright Fellow]] (1977–78) at the [[University of London]]. He was a college professor in history and politics before becoming a politician.

==Early political career==
Following his mother Helen, who served as a state representative and senator, Cole served in the [[Oklahoma Senate]] from 1988 to 1991, resigning mid-term to accept a job in Washington. From 1995 to 1999, he was Oklahoma's [[Secretary of State of Oklahoma|Secretary of State]] under Governor [[Frank Keating]], and assisted with the recovery efforts following the 1995 [[Oklahoma City bombing]]. He has also served as Chairman of the [[Oklahoma Republican Party]].

Cole has been heavily involved in national politics as well, having served both as Executive Director of the NRCC and as Chief of Staff of the [[Republican National Committee]] (RNC).

Cole spent two years working as a paid consultant for the [[United States Chamber of Commerce]], but his primary involvement in politics was as a [[political consultant]] for candidates. Along with partners Sharon Hargrave Caldwell and Deby Snodgrass, his firm (Cole, Hargrave, Snodgrass and Associates) played a large part in the reconstruction of Oklahoma's political landscape, and backed a number of candidates that took office during the [[Republican Revolution]] of 1994. Among their clients have been Keating, [[J.C. Watts]], [[Tom Coburn]], [[Frank Lucas (politician)|Frank Lucas]], [[Mary Fallin]], [[Wes Watkins]], [[Steve Largent]], former Mississippi congressman [[Chip Pickering]], and Hawaii governor [[Linda Lingle]].

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Elections===
During his initial campaign for the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] in 2002, Cole received the endorsement of Watts, the popular outgoing congressman. This helped him win a hard-fought general election over Democratic nominee and former Oklahoma State Senator Darryl Roberts. Cole subsequently won easy re-election campaigns in 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010, and 2012.

===Tenure===
Following the 2006 election cycle, the members of the House Republican Conference elected Cole to the post of NRCC Chairman, placing him in charge of national efforts to assist Republican candidates for Congress.

His voting record during his nine years in the House marks Cole as a solid conservative with occasional libertarian sympathies. He has consistently voted pro-life and pro-business positions, and established himself as a supporter of free trade, gun rights, the military, veterans, and American Indian issues. He favors loosening immigration restrictions and imposing stricter limits on campaign funds.  In 2012, he sponsored H.R. 5912 which would prohibit public funds from being used for political party conventions.  The legislations passed the House in September but awaits action by the Senate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/hr5912 |title=H.R. 5912: To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to prohibit the use of public funds for political party conventions |accessdate=12 October 2012}}</ref>

Cole has consistently voted against positions supported by lobbies for senior citizens, labor unions, and teachers' unions. However, he was critical in brokering protections for [[United States Department of Defense|DOD]] civilian workers.[http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/members/c001053/]

In June 2013, after another failure of the [[United States farm bill]] in Congress, Cole called the failure of the legislation inexcusable. His district in [[Oklahoma]] includes some of the state’s [[Agriculture|farming]] communities, and if the Farm Bill passed, it would have saved $40 billion over a ten-year period.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://newsok.com/oklahoma-reps.-tom-cole-jim-bridenstine-disagree-on-farm-bill/article/3854974 |title=Oklahoma Reps. Tom Cole, Jim Bridenstine Disagree on Farm Bill |last1=Casteel |first1=Chris |date=June 21, 2013 |publisher=NewsOK |accessdate=20 July 2013}}</ref>

As Chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on the Legislative Branch, Cole was responsible for introducing the [[Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 2015 (H.R. 4487; 113th Congress)]].<ref name=4487allactions>{{cite web|title=H.R. 4487 - All Actions|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/4487/all-actions/|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=2 May 2014}}</ref> The bill would appropriate $3.3 billion to the legislative branch for FY 2015, which is approximately the same amount it received in FY 2014.<ref name=nextweek25ap>{{cite news|last=Marcos|first=Cristina|title=Next week:Appropriations season begins|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/scheduling/204424-next-week-appropriations-season-begins|accessdate=1 May 2014|newspaper=The Hill|date=25 April 2014}}</ref> According to  Cole, the bill meets its goals "in both an effective and efficient manner, and has done so in a genuinely bipartisan, inclusive and deliberative fashion."<ref name=RCHess2Ap>{{cite news|last=Hess|first=Hannah|title=Legislative Branch Bill Keeps House Spending in Check|url=http://www.rollcall.com/news/legislative_branch_bill_keeps_house_spending_in_check-231875-1.html|accessdate=14 May 2014|newspaper=Roll Call|date=2 April 2014}}</ref>

'''Thomas Jeffery "Tom" Cole''' (born April 28, 1949) is the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|OK|4}}, serving since 2003. He is a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. He is a Deputy [[Party whips of the United States House of Representatives|Majority Whip]]. The chairman of the [[National Republican Congressional Committee]] (NRCC) from 2006 to 2008, he was, during his tenure, the fourth-ranking [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] leader in the House. As of 2012, Cole – a member of the [[Chickasaw]] Nation – is one of only two registered [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] in Congress (the other being fellow Oklahoman [[Markwayne Mullin]]).

==Early life, education, and educating career==
Cole was born in [[Shreveport, Louisiana]], the son of Helen Te Ata (née Gale) and John D. Cole.<ref>http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~battle/reps/cole.htm</ref> He is a fifth-generation Oklahoman, having been raised in [[Moore, Oklahoma]]. He graduated from [[Grinnell College]] in 1971 with a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in [[history]]. His postgraduate degrees include an [[Master of Arts (postgraduate)|M.A.]] from [[Yale University]] (1974) and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] from the [[University of Oklahoma]] (1984), both in [[British history]]. Cole did research abroad as a [[Thomas J. Watson Fellow]] and was a [[Fulbright Fellow]] (1977–78) at the [[University of London]]. He was a college professor in history and politics before becoming a politician.

==Early political career==
Following his mother Helen, who served as a state representative and senator, Cole served in the [[Oklahoma Senate]] from 1988 to 1991, resigning mid-term to accept a job in Washington. From 1995 to 1999, he was Oklahoma's [[Secretary of State of Oklahoma|Secretary of State]] under Governor [[Frank Keating]], and assisted with the recovery efforts following the 1995 [[Oklahoma City bombing]]. He has also served as Chairman of the [[Oklahoma Republican Party]].

Cole has been heavily involved in national politics as well, having served both as Executive Director of the NRCC and as Chief of Staff of the [[Republican National Committee]] (RNC).

Cole spent two years working as a paid consultant for the [[United States Chamber of Commerce]], but his primary involvement in politics was as a [[political consultant]] for candidates. Along with partners Sharon Hargrave Caldwell and Deby Snodgrass, his firm (Cole, Hargrave, Snodgrass and Associates) played a large part in the reconstruction of Oklahoma's political landscape, and backed a number of candidates that took office during the [[Republican Revolution]] of 1994. Among their clients have been Keating, [[J.C. Watts]], [[Tom Coburn]], [[Frank Lucas (politician)|Frank Lucas]], [[Mary Fallin]], [[Wes Watkins]], [[Steve Largent]], former Mississippi congressman [[Chip Pickering]], and Hawaii governor [[Linda Lingle]].

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Elections===
During his initial campaign for the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] in 2002, Cole received the endorsement of Watts, the popular outgoing congressman. This helped him win a hard-fought general election over Democratic nominee and former Oklahoma State Senator Darryl Roberts. Cole subsequently won easy re-election campaigns in 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010, and 2012.

===Tenure===
Following the 2006 election cycle, the members of the House Republican Conference elected Cole to the post of NRCC Chairman, placing him in charge of national efforts to assist Republican candidates for Congress.

His voting record during his nine years in the House marks Cole as a solid conservative with occasional libertarian sympathies. He has consistently voted pro-life and pro-business positions, and established himself as a supporter of free trade, gun rights, the military, veterans, and American Indian issues. He favors loosening immigration restrictions and imposing stricter limits on campaign funds.  In 2012, he sponsored H.R. 5912 which would prohibit public funds from being used for political party conventions.  The legislations passed the House in September but awaits action by the Senate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/hr5912 |title=H.R. 5912: To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to prohibit the use of public funds for political party conventions |accessdate=12 October 2012}}</ref>

Cole has consistently voted against positions supported by lobbies for senior citizens, labor unions, and teachers' unions. However, he was critical in brokering protections for [[United States Department of Defense|DOD]] civilian workers.[http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/members/c001053/]

In June 2013, after another failure of the [[United States farm bill]] in Congress, Cole called the failure of the legislation inexcusable. His district in [[Oklahoma]] includes some of the state’s [[Agriculture|farming]] communities, and if the Farm Bill passed, it would have saved $40 billion over a ten-year period.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://newsok.com/oklahoma-reps.-tom-cole-jim-bridenstine-disagree-on-farm-bill/article/3854974 |title=Oklahoma Reps. Tom Cole, Jim Bridenstine Disagree on Farm Bill |last1=Casteel |first1=Chris |date=June 21, 2013 |publisher=NewsOK |accessdate=20 July 2013}}</ref>

As Chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on the Legislative Branch, Cole was responsible for introducing the [[Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 2015 (H.R. 4487; 113th Congress)]].<ref name=4487allactions>{{cite web|title=H.R. 4487 - All Actions|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/4487/all-actions/|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=2 May 2014}}</ref> The bill would appropriate $3.3 billion to the legislative branch for FY 2015, which is approximately the same amount it received in FY 2014.<ref name=nextweek25ap>{{cite news|last=Marcos|first=Cristina|title=Next week:Appropriations season begins|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/scheduling/204424-next-week-appropriations-season-begins|accessdate=1 May 2014|newspaper=The Hill|date=25 April 2014}}</ref> According to  Cole, the bill meets its goals "in both an effective and efficient manner, and has done so in a genuinely bipartisan, inclusive and deliberative fashion."<ref name=RCHess2Ap>{{cite news|last=Hess|first=Hannah|title=Legislative Branch Bill Keeps House Spending in Check|url=http://www.rollcall.com/news/legislative_branch_bill_keeps_house_spending_in_check-231875-1.html|accessdate=14 May 2014|newspaper=Roll Call|date=2 April 2014}}</ref>
