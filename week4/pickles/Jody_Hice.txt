Hice is the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] member-elect for [[Georgia's 10th congressional district]] in the [[United States House of Representatives elections in Georgia, 2014#District 10|2014 elections]].

==Early life==
Hice is a native of [[Atlanta]] and received his Bachelor of Arts degree from [[Asbury University|Asbury College]] in [[Wilmore, Kentucky]], a Master of Divinity degree from [[Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary]] in [[Fort Worth, Texas]], and a Doctor of Ministry degree from [[Luther Rice Seminary]] in Atlanta, Georgia.<ref>[http://www.jodyhice.com/JodyBio.php Bio of Jody Hice]</ref>

Hice first served as senior pastor of Bethlehem First Baptist Church, until April 2010<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bethlehemfbc.org|title=Jody Hice Pastors First Baptist Church of Bethlehem, GA|publisher=}}</ref> in [[Bethlehem, Georgia]]. In addition, he served as first vice president of the Georgia Baptist Convention (2004–05) and Professor of Preaching at [[Luther Rice Seminary]]. Hice served as senior pastor at The Summit Church, a Southern Baptist church, in [[Loganville, Georgia]] from 2011 until December 2013, when he stepped down to run for office.

==Involvement in cultural issues==
In September 2008, the Reverend Hice was one of 33 pastors across America who participated in "Pulpit Freedom Sunday",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineathens.com/stories/100608/ele_340689679.shtml|title=Jody Hice Returns To National Spotlight With Presidential Endorsement|publisher=}}</ref> an effort that challenged an [[Internal Revenue Service]] code threatening churches and pastors with loss of [[tax-exempt]] status and criminal behavior if they address  political issues from the pulpit. In that sermon, Hice endorsed [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[John McCain]] for [[President of the United States|President]]. The IRS never publicly responded to the event, and Pulpit Freedom Sunday has since grown to include over 450 churches.<ref name="MSN-IRS-R">{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/30391105/|title=Churches await IRS response after protest|date=April 24, 2009|publisher=MSNBC|accessdate=2009-05-20}}</ref>

In January 2009, Hice and [[Aaron Evans]] (a Christian speaker and media personality from Virginia)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aaronevans.org|title=Aaron Evans|publisher=}}</ref> launched [[Hope For America Rallies]] to educate Americans on the Christian influences in America's founding.<ref>[http://www.hfarallies.org Hope For America Rallies]</ref>

==''The Jody Hice Show''==
During the battle between the ACLU and Barrow County, Georgia, regarding the public display of the Ten Commandments in the County Courthouse, Reverend Hice was asked by a local radio station to provide weekly updates and to address various other issues.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jodyhice.com|title=The Jody Hice Show|publisher=}}</ref> Out of that weekly program was started a daily show, ''Let Freedom Ring'', which was originally heard on [[WJBB (AM)|WIMO]] 1300 AM, [[Bethlehem, Georgia]], Monday through Friday. The show is heard on about 400 stations,<ref>[http://www.jodyhice.com/currentStations.php Current Stations Airing The Jody Hice Show]</ref> the show focuses on Constitutional, moral, and religious liberty issues. The show features commentary and interviews with various guests on these topics. The show is now called ''The Jody Hice Show''.

==2014 Congressional Campaign==

The Congressional Seat for Georgia's 10th Congressional District opened up when the sitting representative, [[Paul Broun]], announced his bid for U.S. Senate in 2014.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Killough|first1=Ashley|title=Georgia Rep. Paul Broun to run for Senate|url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2013/02/06/georgia-rep-paul-broun-to-run-for-senate/|publisher=CNN|date=February 6, 2013}}</ref> Jody Hice was the second to formally enter the race on April 15, 2013, citing government spending as his foremost concern.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Galloway|first1=Jim|title=Jody Hice enters GOP race to replace Paul Broun|url=http://www.ajc.com/weblogs/political-insider/2013/apr/15/jody-hice-enters-gop-race-replace-paul-broun/|agency=Atlanta Journal-Constitution|date=April 15, 2013}}</ref> Hice was soon joined by 5 other candidates, leading to [[primary election]] of 7 for the open seat. Hice placed first in the primary on May 20, 2014 with 33.5% of the vote, followed closely by his run-off opponent Mike Collins who won 33% of the vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://results.enr.clarityelections.com/GA/51345/132192/en/summary.html|website=GA Secretary of State Page|title=Ga Election Results}}</ref>

With no candidate wining 50% of the vote, a run-off campaign was issued between the top two candidates, Jody Hice and Mike Collins. The close race quickly grew heated amid accusations of campaign sign theft from both sides and reports of supporters being harassed at debates.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Cochran|first1=Kelsey|title=Hice, Collins campaign heats up with reports of sign thefts, 'shenanigans'|url=http://onlineathens.com/election/2014-07-19/hice-collins-campaign-heats-reports-sign-thefts-shenanigans|publisher=Athens Banner-Herald|date=July 20, 2014}}</ref> Hice ultimately won the run-off, grabbing 54% of the vote.<ref>{{cite web|title=Georgia - Summary Vote Results|url=http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/files/elections/2014/by_state/GA_US_House_0722.html?SITE=CSPANELN&SECTION=POLITICS|publisher=Associated Press}}</ref>

Hice faced a Democratic opponent in November election, which he won in a GOP wave on Nov. 4, 2014.<ref>[http://www.covnews.com/section/1/article/56815/ covnews.com, Jody Hice wins seat in U.S. House, November 4, 2014]</ref>

==Grassroots Campaign Work==

Jody Hice's high-margin victory in his 2014 run-off with Mike Collins has been largely attributed to his comprehensive grassroots campaign. During his primary, Mr. Hice gained a reputation for hiring interns and staff members to do campaign work. A team of as few as ten interns made tens-of-thousands of calls to counteract a Democratic push in the state to elect a more moderate Republican.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.redstate.com/2014/07/10/democrats-deploy-their-mississippi-strategy-against-jody-hice-in-georgia/|title=Jody Hice Returns To National Spotlight With Presidential Endorsement|publisher=}}</ref>

==Criticisms==

National media outlets have drawn attention to Jody Hice's views on Islam regarding his book, "A Call to Reclaim America", in which he claims that Islam is not only a religion, but a geo-political structure and is therefore not deserving of First Amendment protection.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Bookman|first1=Jay|title=Is the First Amendment only for Christians?|url=http://www.ajc.com/weblogs/jay-bookman/2014/jun/23/first-amendment-only-christians/|publisher=Atlanta Journal-Constitution|date=June 23, 2014}}</ref> Hice, in his book ''It's Now or Never'', also quoted former U.S. general Jerry Boykin as stating that there is a Muslim Brotherhood plot to take over the United States.<ref>Hice, Jody,''It's Now or Never'', p.155</ref> Boykin has been classified as an anti-Muslim extremist by the Southern Poverty Law Center.<ref>http://www.splcenter.org/get%20informed/intelligence%20files/profiles/Lieutenant%20General%20William%20G.%20%E2%80%9CJerry%E2%80%9D%20Boykin%20%28Ret.%29</ref>

Hice received national media attention for his social media pages' misattribution of quotes, with the pages claiming that certain quotes posted were from the Founding Fathers, when in fact they were from other sources, such as Dolly Parton or Thoreau. This misattribution received attention in the Flagpole newspaper in Georgia's Tenth District district,<ref>http://flagpole.com/news/in-the-loop/watch-stephen-colbert-skewer-athens-congressional-candidate-jody-hice</ref> on the national program "The Colbert Report,"<ref>http://thecolbertreport.cc.com/videos/zq72u5/the-midterm-round-up</ref> and on MSNBC.<ref>http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/dont-know-much-about-history-jody-hice-edition</ref>

Hice has also drawn criticisms from his comments on opposing gay marriage.<ref>Jody Hice is likely headed to Congress, Sean Sullivan, 23 July 2014, Washington Post</ref> He particularly drew criticism from an episode of his radio show in which he voiced his concerns about banning conversion therapy. In this show he claimed homosexuality is a choice and is indulging a sinful tendency, much like alcoholism or drug abuse.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Sarlin|first1=Benjy|title=Anti-Islam pastor Jody Hice wins Georgia primary|url=http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/ultra-conservative-jody-hice-wins-ga-10-primary|publisher=MSNBC}}</ref>

Hice's views on gender equality have also invited scrutiny. In a 2004 interview with the Athens Banner-Herald, the largest newspaper in Hice's district, Hice stated that a woman had to be "within the authority of her husband" if she wanted to run for public office.<ref>http://onlineathens.com/stories/021504/new_20040215071.shtml</ref>
