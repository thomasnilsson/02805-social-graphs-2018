===Defense spending===
In August 2006, Duckworth called on Congress to audit the estimated $437 billion spent on overseas military and foreign aid since September 11, 2001. She said, "Real and meaningful oversight has taken a back seat to partisan inaction. With the right kind of leadership Congress can bring greater fiscal discipline and accountability to the billions of dollars we are spending on our military efforts."<ref name="Corcoran">{{cite news|publisher=Northbrook Star|date=August 17, 2006|author=Pat Corcoran|title=Duckworth calls for investigation of foreign spending since 9/11|url=http://www.pioneerlocal.com/cgi-bin/ppo-story/localnews/current/nb/08-17-06-1005047.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060821081045/http://www.pioneerlocal.com/cgi-bin/ppo-story/localnews/current/nb/08-17-06-1005047.html|archivedate=August 21, 2006}}</ref>

===Gun control===
On October 10, 2006, Duckworth was endorsed by the [[Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence]]. The endorsement was announced in a joint appearance with the [[Fraternal Order of Police]], who had also endorsed Duckworth. At the press conference in [[Lombard, Illinois]], Duckworth referred to the recent [[school shootings]] and criticized her opponent's opposition to renewing a [[Federal Assault Weapons Ban|Federal ban on semi-automatic firearms]], which expired in 2004. Duckworth claimed, "Basically, whatever the [[National Rifle Association|NRA]] wants, [[Peter Roskam]] will vote for it." She supported the Brady Law, which requires [[background check]]s for gun purchases from federally licensed firearm dealers.<ref name="Trib_Gun_laws">John Biemer and Christi Parsons, [http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/west/chi-0610110053oct11,1,6499430.story?coll=chi-newslocalwest-hed "Gun law heats up race for Congress"], ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', October 11, 2006 (registration required)</ref><ref name="Krol_Gun_Record">Eric Krol, [http://www.dailyherald.com/politics/story.asp?id=237246 "Duckworth takes aim at Roskam gun record"], dailyherald.com, October 11, 2006.</ref>

===Veteran affairs===
At the [[AMVETS|AmVets]]' National [[Symposium]] for the Needs of Young [[Veteran]]s in 2012, Duckworth called for improvements in veterans health care. She called for [[wikt:mandatory|mandatory]] funding of veterans' health care, rather than discretionary funding that could change with political winds; she also wants improvements in transition assistance for those returning to civilian life, particularly for those with [[disabilities]]. Duckworth also wanted the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]] to hire more veterans as doctors and nurses because they understand what combat veterans face, and she wants the VA to prepare for the possibility of severe [[respiratory]] problems in the future for [[Iraq war]] veterans.<ref>[http://www.navytimes.com/legacy/new/1-292925-2298362.php "Candidate Duckworth sounds call to aid injured vets"] by Rick Maze, ''Marine Corps Times'' Retrieved August 13, 2012.</ref>

===Abortion===
According to ''The Washington Post'', Duckworth believes that abortion and end-of-life decisions are private matters and should not be subject to federal restriction.<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/18/AR2006021801295_pf.html After War Injury, an Iraq Vet Takes on Politics]</ref> During her 2006 campaign for U.S. Congress, Duckworth was endorsed by [[EMILY's List]].<ref>Jeff Zeleny and John Biemer .[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-145673843.html Duckworth praised for stance on abortion: EMILY'S List backs congressional hopeful]. ''Chicago Tribune''. May 12, 2006.</ref>

===Education===
On August 23, 2006, Duckworth was endorsed by the Illinois Education Association and the Illinois Federation of Teachers. In accepting the endorsements, Duckworth criticized the Bush administration's education policy of [[No Child Left Behind Act]].<ref>Duckworth for Congress. [http://web.archive.org/web/20061004190328/http://www.duckworthforcongress.com/newsroom_details.asp?id=916 "Duckworth outlines steps that can be taken to improve education."]</ref>

===Iraq War===
[[File:Tammy Duckworth wheelchair.jpg|thumb|right|Duckworth narrates the ''Salute to Fallen Asian Pacific Islander Heroes'' in [[Arlington, Virginia]], June 2, 2005.]]
Duckworth was critical of the administration of President [[George W. Bush]] for its provision of veterans' care, and was chosen by the Democratic Party to give the September 30, 2006, response to President Bush's weekly radio address.<ref>[http://www.dccc.org/news/electronic_media/20060930_duckworth_address/ "Illinois Congressional Candidate Tammy Duckworth to Deliver Democratic Radio Address"], [[Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee]] press release, dated September 30, 2006.</ref><ref>[http://news.bostonherald.com/politics/view.bg?articleid=160047 "War vet turned candidate attacks Bush on Iraq"], Associated Press, September 30, 2006.</ref> Her strategic recommendations included requesting an immediate accounting by the [[U.S. Secretary of Defense]] of the readiness level and the training of the Iraqi forces, followed by aggressive benchmarks for progress and redeployment of U.S. troops linked to the stand-up of Iraqi troops, saying the U.S. should proceed by standing-down a defined number of U.S. units for every Iraqi [[battalion]] that can be properly trained and certified as combat-ready.<ref> [http://web.archive.org/web/20061004185705/http://www.duckworthforcongress.com/newsroom_details.asp?id=921 Duckworth for Congress press release], archive.org, October 4, 2006.</ref>

In 2006, ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' reported that Duckworth agreed with General [[Sir Richard Dannatt]], the [[British Army]] chief, that the presence of coalition troops was exacerbating the conflict:<blockquote>"We're attracting more people to terrorism than ever before. We really need to think about drawing down," she told ''The Sunday Times''. "I want the [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] to come before [[United States Congress|Congress]] and tell us how many Iraqis are fully trained. If two guys can do traffic control in [[Kirkuk]], I want to bring two Americans home."<ref name="times_leads_charge">Sarah Baxter[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,2089-2415686,00.html "War heroine leads Democrat charge"], ''The Sunday Times'', October 22, 2006.</ref></blockquote>

When asked whether she would like to see Bush impeached, Duckworth said that Congress had "far more pressing issues to deal with." {{cn|date=November 2014}}

===Defense spending===
In August 2006, Duckworth called on Congress to audit the estimated $437 billion spent on overseas military and foreign aid since September 11, 2001. She said, "Real and meaningful oversight has taken a back seat to partisan inaction. With the right kind of leadership Congress can bring greater fiscal discipline and accountability to the billions of dollars we are spending on our military efforts."<ref name="Corcoran">{{cite news|publisher=Northbrook Star|date=August 17, 2006|author=Pat Corcoran|title=Duckworth calls for investigation of foreign spending since 9/11|url=http://www.pioneerlocal.com/cgi-bin/ppo-story/localnews/current/nb/08-17-06-1005047.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060821081045/http://www.pioneerlocal.com/cgi-bin/ppo-story/localnews/current/nb/08-17-06-1005047.html|archivedate=August 21, 2006}}</ref>

===Gun control===
On October 10, 2006, Duckworth was endorsed by the [[Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence]]. The endorsement was announced in a joint appearance with the [[Fraternal Order of Police]], who had also endorsed Duckworth. At the press conference in [[Lombard, Illinois]], Duckworth referred to the recent [[school shootings]] and criticized her opponent's opposition to renewing a [[Federal Assault Weapons Ban|Federal ban on semi-automatic firearms]], which expired in 2004. Duckworth claimed, "Basically, whatever the [[National Rifle Association|NRA]] wants, [[Peter Roskam]] will vote for it." She supported the Brady Law, which requires [[background check]]s for gun purchases from federally licensed firearm dealers.<ref name="Trib_Gun_laws">John Biemer and Christi Parsons, [http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/west/chi-0610110053oct11,1,6499430.story?coll=chi-newslocalwest-hed "Gun law heats up race for Congress"], ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', October 11, 2006 (registration required)</ref><ref name="Krol_Gun_Record">Eric Krol, [http://www.dailyherald.com/politics/story.asp?id=237246 "Duckworth takes aim at Roskam gun record"], dailyherald.com, October 11, 2006.</ref>

===Veteran affairs===
At the [[AMVETS|AmVets]]' National [[Symposium]] for the Needs of Young [[Veteran]]s in 2012, Duckworth called for improvements in veterans health care. She called for [[wikt:mandatory|mandatory]] funding of veterans' health care, rather than discretionary funding that could change with political winds; she also wants improvements in transition assistance for those returning to civilian life, particularly for those with [[disabilities]]. Duckworth also wanted the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]] to hire more veterans as doctors and nurses because they understand what combat veterans face, and she wants the VA to prepare for the possibility of severe [[respiratory]] problems in the future for [[Iraq war]] veterans.<ref>[http://www.navytimes.com/legacy/new/1-292925-2298362.php "Candidate Duckworth sounds call to aid injured vets"] by Rick Maze, ''Marine Corps Times'' Retrieved August 13, 2012.</ref>

===Iraq War===
[[File:Tammy Duckworth wheelchair.jpg|thumb|right|Duckworth narrates the ''Salute to Fallen Asian Pacific Islander Heroes'' in [[Arlington, Virginia]], June 2, 2005.]]

Bush]] for its provision of veterans' care, and was chosen by the Democratic Party to give the September 30, 2006, response to President Bush's weekly radio address.<ref>[http://www.dccc.org/news/electronic_media/20060930_duckworth_address/ "Illinois Congressional Candidate Tammy Duckworth to Deliver Democratic Radio Address"], [[Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee]] press release, dated September 30, 2006.</ref><ref>[http://news.bostonherald.com/politics/view.bg?articleid=160047 "War vet turned candidate attacks Bush on Iraq"], Associated Press, September 30, 2006.</ref> Her strategic recommendations included requesting an immediate accounting by the [[U.S. Secretary of Defense]] of the readiness level and the training of the Iraqi forces, followed by aggressive benchmarks for progress and redeployment of U.S. troops linked to the stand-up of Iraqi troops, saying the U.S. should proceed by standing-down a defined number of U.S. units for every Iraqi [[battalion]] that can be properly trained and certified as combat-ready.<ref> [http://web.archive.org/web/20061004185705/http://www.duckworthforcongress.com/newsroom_details.asp?id=921 Duckworth for Congress press release], archive.org, October 4, 2006.</ref>

In 2006, ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' reported that Duckworth agreed with General [[Sir Richard Dannatt]], the [[British Army]] chief, that the presence of coalition troops was exacerbating the conflict:<blockquote>"We're attracting more people to terrorism than ever before. We really need to think about drawing down," she told ''The Sunday Times''. "I want the [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] to come before [[United States Congress|Congress]] and tell us how many Iraqis are fully trained. If two guys can do traffic control in [[Kirkuk]], I want to bring two Americans home."<ref name="times_leads_charge">Sarah Baxter[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,2089-2415686,00.html "War heroine leads Democrat charge"], ''The Sunday Times'', October 22, 2006.</ref></blockquote>

When asked whether she would like to see Bush impeached, Duckworth said that Congress had "far more pressing issues to deal with." {{cn|date=November 2014}}

===Defense spending===
In August 2006, Duckworth called on Congress to audit the estimated $437 billion spent on overseas military and foreign aid since September 11, 2001.

With the right kind of leadership Congress can bring greater fiscal discipline and accountability to the billions of dollars we are spending on our military efforts."<ref name="Corcoran">{{cite news|publisher=Northbrook Star|date=August 17, 2006|author=Pat Corcoran|title=Duckworth calls for investigation of foreign spending since 9/11|url=http://www.pioneerlocal.com/cgi-bin/ppo-story/localnews/current/nb/08-17-06-1005047.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060821081045/http://www.pioneerlocal.com/cgi-bin/ppo-story/localnews/current/nb/08-17-06-1005047.html|archivedate=August 21, 2006}}</ref>

We really need to think about drawing down," she told ''The Sunday Times''. "I want the [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] to come before [[United States Congress|Congress]] and tell us how many Iraqis are fully trained. If two guys can do traffic control in [[Kirkuk]], I want to bring two Americans home."<ref name="times_leads_charge">Sarah Baxter[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,2089-2415686,00.html "War heroine leads Democrat charge"], ''The Sunday Times'', October 22, 2006.</ref></blockquote>

When asked whether she would like to see Bush impeached, Duckworth said that Congress had "far more pressing issues to deal with." {{cn|date=November 2014}}

===Defense spending===
In August 2006, Duckworth called on Congress to audit the estimated $437 billion spent on overseas military and foreign aid since September 11, 2001. She said, "Real and meaningful oversight has taken a back seat to partisan inaction. With the right kind of leadership Congress can bring greater fiscal discipline and accountability to the billions of dollars we are spending on our military efforts."<ref name="Corcoran">{{cite news|publisher=Northbrook Star|date=August 17, 2006|author=Pat Corcoran|title=Duckworth calls for investigation of foreign spending since 9/11|url=http://www.pioneerlocal.com/cgi-bin/ppo-story/localnews/current/nb/08-17-06-1005047.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060821081045/http://www.pioneerlocal.com/cgi-bin/ppo-story/localnews/current/nb/08-17-06-1005047.html|archivedate=August 21, 2006}}</ref>

===Gun control===
On October 10, 2006, Duckworth was endorsed by the [[Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence]]. The endorsement was announced in a joint appearance with the [[Fraternal Order of Police]], who had also endorsed Duckworth. At the press conference in [[Lombard, Illinois]], Duckworth referred to the recent [[school shootings]] and criticized her opponent's opposition to renewing a [[Federal Assault Weapons Ban|Federal ban on semi-automatic firearms]], which expired in 2004. Duckworth claimed, "Basically, whatever the [[National Rifle Association|NRA]] wants, [[Peter Roskam]] will vote for it." She supported the Brady Law, which requires [[background check]]s for gun purchases from federally licensed firearm dealers.<ref name="Trib_Gun_laws">John Biemer and Christi Parsons, [http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/west/chi-0610110053oct11,1,6499430.story?coll=chi-newslocalwest-hed "Gun law heats up race for Congress"], ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', October 11, 2006 (registration required)</ref><ref name="Krol_Gun_Record">Eric Krol, [http://www.dailyherald.com/politics/story.asp?id=237246 "Duckworth takes aim at Roskam gun record"], dailyherald.com, October 11, 2006.</ref>
