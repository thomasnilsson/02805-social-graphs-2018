'''Nita Melnikoff Lowey''' (born July 5, 1937) is an [[United States|American]] politician who has served as a [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for [[New York]] since 1989. She is a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. Lowey's district was numbered as the 20th from 1989 to 1993, as the 18th from 1993 to 2013, and has been the {{ushr|NY|17|17th}} since 2013.

==Early life, education, and early political career==
Lowey was born in [[the Bronx]] in [[New York, New York]] and graduated from [[The Bronx High School of Science]] and then [[Mount Holyoke College]] with a bachelor's degree. She served as a government official before entering elected politics and was once the Assistant Secretary of State of New York.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Elections===
Lowey was first elected to the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] from [[New York's 20th congressional district]] in [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1988|1988]]. Following [[redistricting]] after the [[1990 United States Census|1990 Census]], Lowey was elected from the [[New York's 18th congressional district|18th district]]. Her district is located in the northern suburbs of [[New York City]] and includes most of [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] including [[New Rochelle, New York|New Rochelle]], [[White Plains, New York|White Plains]], [[Chappaqua, New York|Chappaqua]], [[Greenburgh, New York|Greenburgh]], [[Scarsdale, New York|Scarsdale]], [[Tarrytown, New York|Tarrytown]], [[Mamaroneck (village), New York|Mamaroneck]], [[Ossining (town), New York|Ossining]], and part of [[Yonkers, New York|Yonkers]], as well as part of eastern [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]], including the county seat [[New City, New York|New City]], [[Haverstraw (village), New York|Haverstraw]], and [[Congers, New York|Congers]]. She used to represent parts of [[Queens]] and the [[Bronx]], until redistricting after the [[2000 United States Census|2000 Census]] created her current district.

Lowey strongly considered [[New York United States Senate election, 2000|running for the United States Senate in 2000]], but stepped aside when [[First Lady of the United States]] [[Hillary Rodham Clinton]] announced her candidacy. Lowey was considered a top contender for appointment to Clinton's Senate seat after Clinton was nominated to be [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], but in a December 1, 2008 phone interview with the [[Associated Press]], she stated that she isn't interested in giving up her senior seat on the House Appropriations Committee.<ref>[http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/C/CLINTON_SUCCESSOR?SITE=CASRP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT ]{{dead link|date=August 2010}}</ref>

In 2004, Lowey received 69% of the vote against political newcomer [[Richard A. Hoffman]], a Wall Street investor and largely self-funded candidate who ran on a platform of opposing special interests and cutting federal taxes. Lowey emphasized her track record on homeland security issues, notably her work to reform the formula for distributing homeland security grants to states.

In 2006, also against Hoffman, Lowey won with 70%.

Lowey was re-elected to an eleventh term in 2008, with 68% of the vote against unsupported [[James C. Russell|James C. "Jim" Russell]].

===Tenure===
Lowey received an "A" on the [[Drum Major Institute]]'s 2005 [http://www.drummajorinstitute.com/congress/drum-major-voting-summary.php?name=Lowey&state=NY&database=house Congressional Scorecard] on middle-class issues. She received 12% on the [[Club for Growth]]'s 2007 congressional scorecard.<ref>[http://www.clubforgrowth.org/2008/05/the_2007_congressional_scoreca.php ]{{dead link|date=August 2010}}</ref> According to the conservative [[Heritage Foundation]], Lowey consistently votes in support of the policies of the Democratic party, and is seen as a strong and effective progressive voice in that legislative body.<ref>{{cite web|last=Baker |first=Jena |url=http://www.heritage.org/research/budget/wm2595.cfm |title=New Budget Estimates Show Unsustainable Spending and Debt &#124; The Heritage Foundation |publisher=Heritage.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref>

Her voting record on mass surveillance earned her a "D" on the [https://www.standagainstspying.org/scorecard Stand Against Spying Congressional Scorecard], which was created by a coalition of organizations and individuals from across the political spectrum advocating for transparency and an end to mass surveillance.<ref>https://standagainstspying.org/scorecard/</ref>

Early in her Congressional career, Lowey sponsored an [[Earmark (politics)|earmark]] for the purpose of "dredging the [[Mamaroneck (town), New York|Mamaroneck]] Harbor."<ref name=Carney>Carney, Timothy (2011-03-16) [http://washingtonexaminer.com/blogs/beltway-confidential/2011/03/government-yachters Government for the Yachters], ''[[Washington Examiner]]''</ref> According to the local newspaper, ''[[The Journal News]]'', the dredging was proposed because "the harbor was becoming too shallow 'to accommodate the larger [[yacht]]s.'"<ref name=Carney/>

In 2001–2002, Lowey was the first female chair of the [[Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee]]. She was a member of the [[House Appropriations Committee]].{{When|date=February 2011}}

One of the notable causes she supports is the [[Corporation for Public Broadcasting]], in support of which she appeared at a congressional hearing accompanied  by ''[[Sesame Street]]'' characters Bert and Ernie.

Lowey has been a vocal advocate for a Security Council Resolution on the [[Darfur conflict|conflict in Darfur]]. She is responsible for the $500 million in the Emergency Spending Bill for Aid in Darfur. She is also pushing for $1.2 Billion in the next fiscal year.

Lowey voted for HR 2454, the "Cap and Trade" legislation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aboutpolitics.com/politicians/New%20York-NY/Lowey/Budget,%20Spending%20and%20Taxes |title=Political Voting Records: New York-NY, Lowey: Budget, Spending and Taxes |publisher=Aboutpolitics.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref>

Lowey voted for HR 1105, the 2009 Budget Bill.

She was strongly critical of the [[Stupak-Pitts Amendment]], which places limits on taxpayer-funded abortions in the context of the November 2009 [[Affordable Health Care for America Act]]. Because of the rancor and disruptions which marked so many of the so-called Town Hall meetings held in the summer of 2009 to discuss Health Care Reform, Lowey chose to present her point of view on Health Care Reform in a telephone conference call, the effectiveness of which was questioned by some of her constituents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://polhudson.lohudblogs.com/2009/08/07/are-telephone-town-hall-meetings-democratic/ |title=Are telephone Town Hall meetings Democratic? &#124; Politics on the Hudson |publisher=Polhudson.lohudblogs.com |date=2009-08-07 |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref> However, Lowey routinely appears around her district to talk one-on-one with her constituents at town fairs, events and public meetings.
