'''Leon Acton "Lynn" Westmoreland''' (born April 2, 1950) is the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|Georgia|3|}}, serving since 2007. He is a member of the [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]]. The district stretches from the far southern [[Atlanta]] suburbs to the suburbs of [[Columbus, Georgia|Columbus]]. He previously represented [[Georgia's 8th congressional district]] from 2005 to 2007.

==Early life, education and career==
Westmoreland was born in Atlanta, Georgia, the son of Margaret Ferrell (née Lawson) and Leon Acton Westmoreland.<ref>http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~battle/reps/westmoreland.htm</ref> He grew up in metro Atlanta. He has no degree beyond a high school diploma. He attended [[Georgia State University]], but dropped out to work in a family construction business in which he later became an executive. He served in the [[Georgia House of Representatives]] from 1993 to 2005, rising to the position of House Republican Leader in 2001. He held that position until 2003 when he stepped down in order to devote time to his Congressional campaign in late 2003. He continued to serve in the Georgia House until his election to the U.S. House in 2005.

As Republican Leader in the Georgia House, he led the fight against intense partisan [[gerrymandering]] during the redistricting process controlled by the Democratic majority in 2001. He was instrumental in the mid-decade redistricting that took place in 2005 after Republicans won control of the Georgia legislature in the 2004 elections.<ref name=WashTimes>{{cite news |url=http://images.washtimes.com/national/20050225-111610-4014r.htm |title=Election districts drawing attention |publisher=The Washington Times |date=February 26, 2005 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061101011854/http://images.washtimes.com/national/20050225-111610-4014r.htm |archivedate=November 1, 2006}}</ref><ref name="NYT">http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/20/us/20murphy.html</ref><ref>[http://times-georgian.com/view/full_story/3278580/article-Georgia--Carroll--Haralson-remember-Tom-Murphy Times-Georgian - Georgia Carroll Haralson remember Tom Murphy<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

During his first term in the [[109th United States Congress]], Westmoreland was appointed to the [[U.S. House Committee on Small Business]], [[U.S. House Committee on Government Reform]], and the [[U.S. House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

As a U.S. congressman, Westmoreland cosponsored a bill to place the [[Ten Commandments]] in the House of Representatives and the [[United States Senate|Senate]].

Westmoreland and his colleagues claimed that it was no longer fair to target their states, given the passage of time since 1965 and the changes their states had made to provide fair elections and voting.

==Controversy==
On September 4, 2008, Westmoreland described [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] presidential nominee [[Barack Obama]] and his wife [[Michelle Obama|Michelle]] as "[[wiktionary:uppity|uppity]]," a pejorative considered by some as historically used to describe African-Americans who have made economic, social, or political progress.<ref name="LATimes">[http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-shipler16apr16,0,2335261.story The Resonance of Racism], April 16, 2008, ''[[Los Angeles Times]].''</ref> He told reporters: "Just from what little I’ve seen of her and Mr. Obama, Senator Obama, they're a member of an elitist-class individual that thinks that they're uppity," Westmoreland said. Asked to clarify that he used the word "uppity," Westmoreland said, "Uppity, yeah."<ref name="HILL">[http://thehill.com/leading-the-news/westmoreland-calls-obama-uppity-2008-09-04.html Westmoreland Calls Obama Uppity], September 4, 2008, [[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]].</ref><ref>[http://www.cqpolitics.com/cq-assets/cqmultimedia/audio/uppity.mp3 Audio recording of Rep. Westmoreland referring to Obamas as "uppity"]</ref>

The ensuing media attention compelled Westmoreland to issue the following statement: "I’ve never heard that term used in a racially derogatory sense. It is important to note that the dictionary definition of 'uppity' is 'affecting an air of inflated self-esteem—snobbish.' That's what we meant by uppity when we used it in the mill village where I grew up."<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2008/09/rep-westmorelan.html|work=The Los Angeles Times|title=Top of the Ticket|date=September 5, 2008}}</ref>

==Political campaigns==
Westmoreland won a plurality of votes in the Republican primary election in 2004, but faced fellow Republican Dylan Glenn in a runoff. Westmoreland received 55.5% of the vote in the runoff. The district was so heavily Republican that Westmoreland's primary victory was [[tantamount to election]] in November. He routed his [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] opponent, businesswoman Silvia Delamar, with almost 76% of the vote. He was handily reelected in 2006 after his district was renumbered as the 3rd and made even more Republican than before.

==Personal life==
He resides in [[Grantville, Georgia]], with his wife, Joan; they have three children and seven grandchildren.

==Controversy==
On September 4, 2008, Westmoreland described [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] presidential nominee [[Barack Obama]] and his wife [[Michelle Obama|Michelle]] as "[[wiktionary:uppity|uppity]]," a pejorative considered by some as historically used to describe African-Americans who have made economic, social, or political progress.<ref name="LATimes">[http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-shipler16apr16,0,2335261.story The Resonance of Racism], April 16, 2008, ''[[Los Angeles Times]].''</ref> He told reporters: "Just from what little I’ve seen of her and Mr. Obama, Senator Obama, they're a member of an elitist-class individual that thinks that they're uppity," Westmoreland said. Asked to clarify that he used the word "uppity," Westmoreland said, "Uppity, yeah."<ref name="HILL">[http://thehill.com/leading-the-news/westmoreland-calls-obama-uppity-2008-09-04.html Westmoreland Calls Obama Uppity], September 4, 2008, [[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]].</ref><ref>[http://www.cqpolitics.com/cq-assets/cqmultimedia/audio/uppity.mp3 Audio recording of Rep. Westmoreland referring to Obamas as "uppity"]</ref>

The ensuing media attention compelled Westmoreland to issue the following statement: "I’ve never heard that term used in a racially derogatory sense. It is important to note that the dictionary definition of 'uppity' is 'affecting an air of inflated self-esteem—snobbish.' That's what we meant by uppity when we used it in the mill village where I grew up."<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2008/09/rep-westmorelan.html|work=The Los Angeles Times|title=Top of the Ticket|date=September 5, 2008}}</ref>

==Political campaigns==
Westmoreland won a plurality of votes in the Republican primary election in 2004, but faced fellow Republican Dylan Glenn in a runoff. Westmoreland received 55.5% of the vote in the runoff. The district was so heavily Republican that Westmoreland's primary victory was [[tantamount to election]] in November. He routed his [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] opponent, businesswoman Silvia Delamar, with almost 76% of the vote. He was handily reelected in 2006 after his district was renumbered as the 3rd and made even more Republican than before.

==Personal life==
He resides in [[Grantville, Georgia]], with his wife, Joan; they have three children and seven grandchildren.
