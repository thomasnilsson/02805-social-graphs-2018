===Environmental issues===
Rahall believes that anthropogenic [[Carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]] emissions are causing [[global warming]], saying to the ''Register-Herald'' that denial of climate change is "to just put your head in the sand."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.register-herald.com/todaysfrontpage/x935815715/U-S-HOUSE-CANDIDATE-CONVERSATIONS-Nick-Rahall |title=U.S. HOUSE CANDIDATE CONVERSATIONS — Nick Rahall |publisher=Register Herald |date= |accessdate=October 14, 2010}}</ref>

Rahall has called the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] “callous”, attacked greenhouse gas rule as “disastrous” and filed legislation to block the president’s climate agenda, but in the summer of 2013 he attended a ceremony to rename the EPA headquarters and has praised EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy.<ref name=politico/> Rahall, alongside three other Democrats, supported a GOP bill that would limit EPA authority on CO2 emissions, the [[Energy Tax Prevention Act]]. He commented on this, saying: “I am dead set against the E.P.A.’s plowing ahead on its own with new regulations to limit greenhouse gases.”<ref name=wapo1>{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/03/03/AR2011030302312.html|title=Dems join GOP in fight to block EPA climate rules|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=October 2, 2014}}</ref> He also voted against the [[American Clean Energy and Security Act]].

In 2007, Rahall introduced the [[Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007]], which banned incandescent light bulbs.

As result of the legislation, as of January 1, 2014 incandescent light bulbs between 40 watts and 150 watts are illegal to manufacture or import.

In 2013, Rahall voted for the [[Progressive Caucus|Progressive Caucus's]] budget, which included provisions for a carbon tax.

===Foreign policy===
Rahall and another Congressman of Arab descent traveled to Syria and ignored [[State Department]] policy by meeting with Palestinian leader [[Yasser Arafat]], whom Rahall had known for years.<ref name=candidate/>  [[Queen Noor of Jordan]] presented Rahall with the first Najeeb Halaby Award for public service.<ref name=candidate/>

Rahall opposed the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]]. Rahall had traveled to Baghdad just before the Iraq War with the intention of convincing Iraqi leaders to allow the U.N. to inspect Iraq's weapons and have access to every site. He said that [[Tareq Aziz]] had accepted all of Bush's demands, and that "Bush said the war was not inevitable, but we now know that wasn’t true. Iraqis did allow for complete access but Bush’s mind was already made up. Iraqis were damned if they did and damned if they didn’t .... We were falsely led into this war.”<ref name=WRMEA/>

In 2004, it was reported that Rahall feared that Syria would be attacked by Bush before the November elections. He said that “They’re using the same rhetoric against the Syrians they used against Iraqis.... We now have the Syrian Accountability Act. All this despite the State Department’s admission that Syria helped us capture key al-Qaeda operatives and helped save American lives.”  As for Saudi Arabia, Rahall said that the U.S. “wouldn’t dare” attack that country: “The Kingdom has been a key ally for decades.”<ref name=WRMEA/>

===Ethical issues===
In 2004, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' ran an article about Rahall and his sister, lobbyist Tanya Rahall. They reported that she made $15,000 per month as a [[lobbyist]] for [[Qatar]], and that "the person she frequently lobbies is ... her older brother and one of Qatar's biggest champions in Washington.”  Rahall said “our paths cross professionally, but not across any lines appropriately established by law or House rules.”<ref name=sib/> In May 2003, a year after his sister took on Qatar as a client, Rahall sponsored a resolution praising Qatar's "years of democratic reform"; according to one academic study from 2011, "For over three years, the country [Qatar] virtually had its own congressman in Washington, Nick Rahall (D-WV)".<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=NXLHAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA91|title=Saudi Arabia and the Global Islamic Terrorist Network|publisher=Palgrave MacMillan|chapter=The Saudi Penetration into American NGOs|first1=Kyle|last1=Shiderer|first2=Ilan|last2=Weinglass|pages=81–104|editor1-first=Sarah|editor1-last=Stern|accessdate=October 2, 2014}}</ref>

In February 2005, Rahall used Congressional stationery to write a letter to a [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax County]] judge, David Stitt, asking for leniency for his son, Nick Rahall III, who was facing [[felony]] robbery charges.  According to the House ethics manual: “Official stationery ... may be used only for official purposes." Rahall acknowledged that he should not have used Congressional stationery for his letter, but said it was not the same type that he uses for official or committee business. Rahall added he may have drawn the wrong paper "[i]n the emotions", and that he would reimburse the Treasury Department for the cost of the paper.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0810/41002.html |title=Questions raised about Nick Rahall helping son |publisher=Politico |author=John Bresnahan|date= August 12, 2010 |accessdate=August 12, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gOM2iJE7aLkxUUMwsRwn0VcNeCbwD9HI7LOG0 |title=Democrat Nick Rahall misused official stationery |publisher=Associated Press |date= |accessdate=August 13, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wsaz.com/news/headlines/100592614.html|title=Rahall Admits to Using Congressional Stationary to ask Judge for Favor |accessdate=August 12, 2010|publisher=WSAZ News Channel 3|accessdate=October 3, 2014}}</ref> The [[United States House Committee on Ethics]] did not launch an inquiry into the incident.<ref>{{Cite news  | last = Pergram  | first = Chad  | authorlink =   | coauthors =   | title = Second Congressman allegedly misuses stationary  | work =   | publisher = Fox News  | date = August 12, 2010  | url = http://politics.blogs.foxnews.com/2010/08/12/second-congressman-allegedly-misuses-house-stationery  | format =   | doi =   | accessdate = October 16, 2010}}</ref>

In 2011, the liberal government watchdog non-profit group [[Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington]] (CREW) listed Rahall (and six other Democrats, and 12 Republicans) in its annual "Most Corrupt Members of Congress Report".<ref name=most>{{cite web|url=http://www.charlestondailymail.com/News/statenews/201109203086|title=Rahall on list of most corrupt Congresspeople  |date=September 21, 2011|author=Jared Hunt|publisher=Charleston Daily Mail|accessdate=October 3, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Rep.+Nick+Rahall+%28D-WV%29+Named+One+of+the+Most+Corrupt+Members+of...-a0267424762|title=Rep.

==Personal life==
Rahall and his second wife, Melinda Ross of Ashland, Kentucky, married in 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollcall.com/issues/50_58/-7692-1.html|author= Mary Ann Akers|title=Member Nuptials|work=Roll Call|accessdate=October 2, 2014}}</ref>  They have three children from his previous marriage, and three grandchildren.<ref name=candidate/><ref name=Biography>{{cite web|title=Biography|publisher=rahall.house.gov|url=http://rahall.house.gov/about-me/full-biography}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nickrahall.com/about|title=About Nick Rahall – Nick Rahall for U.S. Congress|publisher=nickrahall.com|accessdate=October 2, 2014}}</ref>

In 2008, Rahall appeared on an episode of ''[[Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives]]'' which featured Hillbilly Hot Dogs of [[Lesage, West Virginia]].  Rahall introduced the hot dog that's named after him on the menu, Rahall's Red Hot Weenie.<ref>{{cite news|last=Lavender|first=Dave|title=Hillbilly Hot Dogs owners featured in host's cookbook and best of episode|url=http://www.herald-dispatch.com/life/x221549205/Hillbilly-Hot-Dogs-owners-featured-in-hosts-cookbook-and-best-of-episode|accessdate=May 23, 2014|newspaper=Herald-Dispatch (Huntington, WV)|date=October 29, 2008}}</ref>

In July 2009, Rahall jumped out of a plane to show his support for the coal industry. The event was intended to show the importance of the coal industry to both West Virginia and the United States as a whole. The act confused some, who questioned the reasoning behind the jump. It was noted that Rahall is involved with coal lobbyists and also receives contributions from the airline industry.<ref name="Plane for Coal">{{cite news|title=Nick Rahall Jumps From a Plane for Coal.
