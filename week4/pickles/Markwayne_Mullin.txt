The second has historically been a classic [[Yellow Dog Democrat|"Yellow Dog" Democratic]] district.  However, it has steadily trended Republican as [[Tulsa]]'s suburbs have spilled into the northern portion of the district.  Additionally, it has always had a strong [[social conservatism|social conservative]] tint. For these reasons, Mullin was thought to have a good chance of winning the election.  In the general election, Mullin defeated Democrat Rob Wallace, a former [[District Attorney]], 57%-38%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=705055 |title=OK - District 02 Race - Nov 06, 2012 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2013-08-30}}</ref> He became the first Republican to represent the district since [[Tom Coburn]] in 2001,<ref name="tulsa">{{cite news | url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?subjectid=262&articleid=20121107_16_EC3_CUTLIN289219 | title=Republican Markwayne Mullin voted into 2nd District Seat | work=Tulsa World | date=November 7, 2012 | accessdate=November 8, 2012 | author=Krehbiel, Mark}}</ref> and only the second since 1921.

On January 20, 2013, the [[CNN]] Politics Political Ticker stated that death threats have been made, of some type, for as yet unspecified motives, against Mullin and his family.

The FBI, local law enforcement, and the U.S. Capitol Police are investigating.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2013/01/20/freshman-congressman-receives-death-threats/?iref=obinsite |title=Freshman congressman receives death threats – CNN Political Ticker - CNN.com Blogs |publisher=Politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com |date=2013-01-20 |accessdate=2013-08-30}}</ref>
