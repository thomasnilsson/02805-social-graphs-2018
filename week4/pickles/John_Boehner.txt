As Speaker of the House, Boehner is second in [[United States presidential line of succession|line to the presidency of the United States]] following the Vice President in accordance with the [[Presidential Succession Act]].

==Early life, education, and career==
Boehner was born in [[Reading, Ohio]], the son of Mary Anne (née Hall) and Earl Henry Boehner, the second of twelve children.

Shortly after his graduation in 1977, Boehner accepted a position with Nucite Sales, a small sales business in the packaging and plastics industry. He was steadily promoted and eventually became president of the firm, resigning in 1990 when he was elected to Congress.<ref name="bio"/>

==Early political career==
From 1982 to 1984, Boehner served on the board of trustees of [[Union Township, Butler County, Ohio]]. He then served as an [[Ohio House of Representatives|Ohio state representative]] from 1985 to 1990.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

==U.S. House of Representatives==
In 1990, Boehner ran against incumbent congressman [[Buz Lukens]], who was under fire for having a sexual relationship with a minor.  He trounced Lukens in the primary, taking 49 percent of the vote.  This was tantamount to election in the heavily Republican 8th District.  He has been reelected 10 times with no substantial opposition, and even ran unopposed in 1994 and 2012.

===Gang of Seven and ''Contract with America''===
During his freshman year, Boehner was a member of the [[Gang of Seven]] which was involved in bringing media attention to the [[House banking scandal]].<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/05/us/politics/05boehner.html A Rabble-Rouser, Then and Now], New York Times, Carl Hulse, July 4, 2009</ref>

Boehner, along with [[Newt Gingrich]] and several other Republican lawmakers, was one of the engineers of the ''[[Contract with America]]'' in 1994 that politically helped Republicans during the 1994 congressional elections during which they won the majority in Congress for the first time in four decades.

===Republican leadership===
From 1995 to 1999, Boehner served as [[Republican Conference Chairman of the United States House of Representatives|House Republican Conference Chairman]] which is the party caucus for Republicans in the United States House of Representatives.  In this post, he was the fourth-ranking House Republican, behind Gingrich, [[House Majority Leader|Majority Leader]] [[Dick Armey]] and [[House Majority Whip|Majority Whip]] [[Tom DeLay]].

During his time as Conference Chairman, Boehner championed the [[Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996|Freedom to Farm Act]] that, among other provisions, revises and simplifies direct payment programs for crops and eliminates milk price supports through direct government purchases.

In the summer of 1997 several House Republicans, who saw [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker]] [[Newt Gingrich]]'s public image as a liability, attempted to replace him as Speaker. The attempted "coup" began July 9 with a meeting between Republican conference chairman Boehner and Republican leadership chairman [[Bill Paxon]] of New York. According to their plan, [[Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives|House Majority Leader]] [[Dick Armey]], [[Party whips of the United States House of Representatives|House Majority Whip]] [[Tom DeLay]], Boehner and Paxon were to present Gingrich with an ultimatum: resign, or be voted out. However, Armey balked at the proposal to make Paxon the new Speaker, and told his chief of staff to warn Gingrich about the coup.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1997/07/21/time/gingrich.html |publisher=CNN|title=Attempted Republican Coup: Ready, Aim, Misfire|accessdate=May 20, 2010}}</ref>

On July 11, Gingrich met with senior Republican leadership to assess the situation. He explained that under no circumstance would he step down. If he was voted out, there would be a new election for Speaker, which would allow for the possibility that Democrats—along with dissenting Republicans—would vote in [[Dick Gephardt]] as Speaker. On July 16, Paxon offered to resign his post, feeling that he had not handled the situation correctly. Paxon was the only unelected member of the leadership group, having been appointed to his position by Gingrich.<ref>{{cite book |title=Lessons Learned the Hard Way |last=Gingrich |first=Newt |year=1998 |publisher=HarperCollins Publishers |isbn=978-0-06-019106-1 |pages=159–160|accessdate=October 19, 2010}}</ref>

In 1998, Boehner was ousted as the chairman of the House Republican Conference, after his party lost five congressional seats.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/02/AR2006020201046.html |title=In an Upset, Boehner Is Elected House GOP Leader |work=The Washington Post |date=March 2, 2006 |accessdate=November 4, 2010 | location=Washington | first=Jonathan | last=Weisman}}</ref>

Following the election of President [[George W. Bush]], Boehner was elected as chairman of the [[U.S. House Committee on Education and the Workforce|House Education and the Workforce Committee]] from 2001 until 2006. There he authored several reforms including the [[Pension Protection Act of 2006|Pension Protection Act]] and a successful school choice voucher program for low-income children in Washington, DC.<ref>{{cite news |author=George F.

Boehner and Senator [[Ted Kennedy]] authored the passage of the [[No Child Left Behind Act of 2001]], which was signed by President [[George W.

===House Republican Leader===
In an upset, Boehner was elected by his colleagues to serve as House Majority Leader on February 2, 2006.  The election followed [[Tom DeLay]]'s resignation from the post after being indicted on criminal charges. Boehner campaigned as a reform candidate who wanted to reform the so-called "[[Earmark (politics)|earmark]]" process and rein in government spending. He defeated Majority Whip [[Roy Blunt]] of [[Missouri]] and Representative [[John Shadegg]] of [[Arizona]], even though he was considered an underdog candidate to Blunt. In the second round of voting by the House Republican Conference, Boehner defeated Blunt with 122 to 109 votes. Blunt kept his previous position as [[Majority Whip]], the No. 3 leadership position in the House. (There was some confusion on the first ballot for Majority Leader as the first count showed one more vote cast than Republicans present,<ref>{{Wayback |date=20060204102043 |url=http://rollcall.com/issues/1_1/breakingnews/12015-1.html |title=Roll Call }}</ref> due to a misunderstanding as to whether the rules allowed Resident Commissioner [[Luis Fortuño]] of Puerto Rico to vote or not).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0602/02/lol.01.html |title=CNN |publisher=CNN |date=February 2, 2006 |accessdate=June 14, 2010}}</ref>

After the Republicans lost control of the House in the 2006 elections, the House Republican Conference chose Boehner as Minority Leader.  While as Majority Leader he was second-in-command behind Speaker [[Dennis Hastert]], as Minority Leader he was the leader of the House Republicans.  As such, he was the Republican nominee for Speaker in 2006 and 2008, losing both times to Pelosi.  While the Speaker is nominally elected by the full House, in practice he or she is almost always chosen by the majority party.

According to the 2008 Congress.org Power Ranking, Boehner was the 6th most powerful congressman (preceded by Speaker Pelosi, Majority Leader Hoyer, Ways and Means Committee Chairman [[Sander M. Levin]], Dean of the House [[John Dingell]], and Appropriations Committee Chairman [[Dave Obey]], all Democrats) and the most powerful Republican.<ref>{{Wayback |date=20080918155340 |url=http://www.congress.org/congressorg/power_rankings/overall.tt }}</ref> As Minority Leader, Boehner served as an ''ex officio'' member of the [[United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence|Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence]].

==Speaker of the House==
[[File:Obama Boehner State of the Union 2011.jpg|thumb|Speaker Boehner greets U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] before the [[2011 State of the Union Address]].]]
The Republicans won a majority in the House of Representatives during the 2010 midterm elections, with a net gain of 63 seats. During his solemn victory speech, Boehner broke into tears when talking about "economic freedom, individual liberty and personal responsibility...I hold these values dear because I've lived them...I've spent my whole life chasing the American Dream".<ref name="Time"/> November 17, 2010, Boehner was unanimously chosen by the House Republicans as their nominee for Speaker,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gopleader.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=215305|title=Boehner: New Leadership "Reflects a New Majority Ready to Listen and Go to Work|publisher=Office of the House Republican Leader|date=November 17, 2010|accessdate=November 19, 2010}}{{dead link|date=June 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/house/129727-boehner-elected-61st-speaker-of-the-house-on-his-61st-birthday|title=Boehner favored as 61st House Speaker on his 61st birthday |publisher=TheHill.com |date=November 17, 2010 |accessdate=November 17, 2010}}</ref> all but assuring his formal election to the post when the new Congress convened with a Republican majority in January 2011.

As Speaker, he is still the leader of the House Republicans. However, by tradition, he normally does not take part in debate, although he has the right to do so, and almost never votes from the floor.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://votesmart.org/candidate/key-votes/27015/john-boehner |title=Representative John Boehner's Voting Records |publisher=[[Project Vote Smart]] |accessdate=October 11, 2013}}</ref> He is not a member of any House committees.

Boehner appeared on ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'' on January 23, 2014. When asked by Leno if he would ever run for president, the Speaker said no, adding, "I like to play golf. I like to cut my own grass. I do drink red wine, I smoke cigarettes.

==Controversies==

===Connections to lobbyists===
In June 1995, Boehner distributed campaign contributions from [[tobacco industry]] [[lobbyist]]s on the House floor as House members were weighing how to vote on tobacco subsidies.<ref>{{cite news|author=Dana Milbank |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/02/AR2006020202571_pf.html |title=Boehner Makes His Political Comeback |work=Washington Post |date=February 3, 2006 |accessdate=November 22, 2010}}</ref> In a 1996 documentary by [[PBS]] called ''The People and the Power Game'', Boehner said "They asked me to give out a half dozen checks quickly before we got to the end of the month and I complied. And I did it on the House floor, which I regret. I should not have done. It's not a violation of the House rules, but it's a practice that‘s gone on here for a long time that we're trying to stop and I know I'll never do it again."<ref>{{Citation

A September 2010 ''[[New York Times]]'' story said Boehner was "Tightly Bound to Lobbyists" and "He maintains especially tight ties with a circle of lobbyists and former aides representing some of the nation’s biggest businesses, including Goldman Sachs, Google, Citigroup, R.J. Reynolds, MillerCoors and UPS.".<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/12/us/politics/12boehner.html?pagewanted=all |title=A G.O.P.

===Smithsonian===
In November 2010, Boehner, along with Minority Whip Eric Cantor, called for the cancellation of an exhibit in the [[Smithsonian]]'s [[National Portrait Gallery (United States)|National Portrait Gallery]] after he learned that it featured a video by [[David Wojnarowicz]], ''A Fire in My Belly'', that contained an image of a [[crucifix]] with ants crawling on it. Boehner spokesman Kevin Smith said, "Smithsonian officials should either acknowledge the mistake and correct it, or be prepared to face tough scrutiny beginning in January when the new majority in the House moves [in]."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/11/30/AR2010113006801.html | work=The Washington Post | first=Jacqueline | last=Trescott | title=Portrait Gallery removes crucifix video from exhibit after complaints | date=December 1, 2010}}</ref>

===Fiscal cliff and Hurricane Sandy relief bill===
On January 1, 2013, after passing the [[fiscal cliff]] [[American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012|deal]], Boehner adjourned the house without passing the $60 million [[Hurricane Sandy relief bill]]. Some Representatives, especially from the Northeast and including Republicans as well as Democrats, and [[New Jersey]] Governor [[Chris Christie]] harshly criticized Boehner.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/video/chris-christie-slams-john-boehner-hurricane-sandy-presser-18120271|title=Gov.

==Political positions==
[[Image:JBoehnerandbush.JPG|thumb|left|Boehner introducing then-president [[George W. Bush]] in [[Troy, Ohio]] in 2003.]]

A profile in the ''[[Pittsburgh Tribune-Review]]'' said, "On both sides of the aisle, Boehner earns praise for candor and an ability to listen."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/pittsburgh/s_624471.html?source=rss&feed=7|title=Boehner's job: Recapture 'squandered' GOP brand|author=Salena Zito|work=Pittsburgh Tribune-Review|date=May 10, 2009|accessdate=June 3, 2009}}</ref>  ''[[The Plain Dealer]]'' says Boehner "has perfected the art of disagreeing without being disagreeable."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://blog.cleveland.com/metro/2009/03/waiting_for_the_banana_peel_ho.html|title=House Republican leader John Boehner of Ohio helps unite GOP|work=The Plain Dealer|author=Sabrina Eaton|date=March 8, 2009|accessdate=June 3, 2009}}</ref>

Boehner has been classified as a "hard-core conservative" by [[OnTheIssues]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.issues2000.org/OH/John_Boehner.htm |title=John Boehner on the Issues |publisher=Issues2000.org |accessdate=June 14, 2010}}</ref> Although Boehner has a conservative voting record, when he was running for House leadership, religious conservatives in the GOP expressed that they were not satisfied with his positions. According to the ''[[Washington Post]]'': "From [[illegal immigration]] to sanctions on China to an overhaul of the pension system, Boehner, as chairman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, took ardently pro-business positions that were contrary to those of many in his party. Religious conservatives – examining his voting record – see him as a policymaker driven by small-government economic concerns, not theirs."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/11/AR2006021100842.html |title=Washington Post |work=Washington Post |date= February 12, 2006|accessdate=June 14, 2010 | first=Jonathan | last=Weisman}}</ref>

Boehner voted for a [[Federal Marriage Amendment]].  In a letter to the Rights Campaign, Boehner stated, "I oppose any legislation that would provide special [[LGBT rights by country or territory|rights for homosexuals]]...  Please be assured that I will continue to work to protect the idea of [[Traditional family|the traditional family]] as one of the fundamental tenets of [[Western culture|western civilization]]."<ref>Equality magazine.

On May 25, 2006, Boehner issued a statement defending his agenda and attacking his "[[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] friends" such as Minority Leader [[Nancy Pelosi]]. Boehner said regarding national security that voters "have a choice between a Republican Party that understands the stakes and is dedicated to victory, and a Democrat Party with a non-existent national security policy that sheepishly dismisses the challenges of a post-[[9/11]] world and is all too willing to concede defeat on the battlefield in [[Iraq]]."

Boehner is a signer of [[Taxpayer Protection Pledge|Americans for Tax Reform]]’s [[Taxpayer Protection Pledge]].<ref name = "ATR">{{cite web|title=The Taxpayer Protection Pledge Signers 112th Congressional List|url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/atrfiles/files/files/091411-federalpledgesigners.pdf|publisher=Americans for Tax Reform|accessdate=November 30, 2011}}</ref>

===Financial crisis===
On September 18, 2008, Congressman Boehner attended a closed meeting with congressional leaders, then-Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, and was urged to craft legislation to help financially troubled banks. That same day (trade effective the next day), Congressman Boehner cashed out of an equity mutual fund.<ref>[http://www.marketplace.org/topics/economy/lawmakers-inside-advantage-trading "Lawmakers’ inside advantage to trading"] ''Marketplace.'' September 17, 2009. Retrieved September 20, 2009</ref>

On October 3, 2008 Boehner voted in favor of the [[Troubled Asset Relief Program]] (TARP),<ref>[http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2008/roll681.xml Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008] Office of the Clerk of the U.S. House of Representatives. October 3, 2008.</ref> believing that [[Article One of the United States Constitution|the enumerated powers]] grant Congress the authority to "purchase assets and equity from financial institutions in order to strengthen its financial sector."
[[Image:President Obama & John Boehner debt ceiling negotions. JPG.JPG|thumb|right|Speaker Boehner meets with President Obama at the White House during the 2011 debt ceiling increase negotiations]]
Boehner has been highly critical of several initiatives by the Democratic Congress and President [[Barack Obama]], including the "[[cap and trade]]" plan that Boehner says would hurt job growth in his congressional district and elsewhere. He opposed the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] and said that, if Republicans took control of the House of Representatives in the 2010 elections, they would do whatever it takes to stop the act. One option would be to defund the administrative aspect of the Act, not paying "one dime" to pay the salaries of the workers who would administer the plan.<ref name="Wereschagin"/> He also led an opposition to the 2009 stimulus and to Obama's first budget proposal, promoting instead an alternative economic recovery plan<ref>{{cite web|url=http://republicanleader.house.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=109659 |title=House GOP Economic Recovery Alternative Will Create 6.2 Million New American Jobs &#124; Republican Leader John Boehner |publisher=Republicanleader.house.gov |accessdate=June 14, 2010}}</ref> and a Republican budget (authored by Ranking Rep.

Boehner favors making changes in [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]], such as by raising the retirement age to 70 for people who have at least 20 years until retirement, as well as tying cost-of-living increases to the [[consumer price index]] rather than [[inflation|wage inflation]], and limiting payments to those who need them.<ref name="Wereschagin">{{Citation| last = Wereschagin | first = Mike| last2 = Zito| first2 = Salena | title = Obama's good for GOP, Boehner says| newspaper = [[Pittsburgh Tribune-Review]]| date = June 29, 2010| url = http://pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/s_688102.html| accessdate =September 12, 2010}}</ref>

In 2011 Boehner called the [[No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act]] “one of our highest legislative priorities.”<ref>Somashekhar, Sandhya.

As Republican House Leader, Boehner is a Democratic target for criticism of Republican views and political positions.

In 1990, Boehner ran against incumbent congressman [[Buz Lukens]], who was under fire for having a sexual relationship with a minor.  He trounced Lukens in the primary, taking 49 percent of the vote.  This was tantamount to election in the heavily Republican 8th District.  He has been reelected 10 times with no substantial opposition, and even ran unopposed in 1994 and 2012.

===Gang of Seven and ''Contract with America''===
During his freshman year, Boehner was a member of the [[Gang of Seven]] which was involved in bringing media attention to the [[House banking scandal]].<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/05/us/politics/05boehner.html A Rabble-Rouser, Then and Now], New York Times, Carl Hulse, July 4, 2009</ref>

Boehner, along with [[Newt Gingrich]] and several other Republican lawmakers, was one of the engineers of the ''[[Contract with America]]'' in 1994 that politically helped Republicans during the 1994 congressional elections during which they won the majority in Congress for the first time in four decades.

===Republican leadership===
From 1995 to 1999, Boehner served as [[Republican Conference Chairman of the United States House of Representatives|House Republican Conference Chairman]] which is the party caucus for Republicans in the United States House of Representatives.  In this post, he was the fourth-ranking House Republican, behind Gingrich, [[House Majority Leader|Majority Leader]] [[Dick Armey]] and [[House Majority Whip|Majority Whip]] [[Tom DeLay]].

During his time as Conference Chairman, Boehner championed the [[Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996|Freedom to Farm Act]] that, among other provisions, revises and simplifies direct payment programs for crops and eliminates milk price supports through direct government purchases.

In the summer of 1997 several House Republicans, who saw [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker]] [[Newt Gingrich]]'s public image as a liability, attempted to replace him as Speaker. The attempted "coup" began July 9 with a meeting between Republican conference chairman Boehner and Republican leadership chairman [[Bill Paxon]] of New York. According to their plan, [[Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives|House Majority Leader]] [[Dick Armey]], [[Party whips of the United States House of Representatives|House Majority Whip]] [[Tom DeLay]], Boehner and Paxon were to present Gingrich with an ultimatum: resign, or be voted out. However, Armey balked at the proposal to make Paxon the new Speaker, and told his chief of staff to warn Gingrich about the coup.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1997/07/21/time/gingrich.html |publisher=CNN|title=Attempted Republican Coup: Ready, Aim, Misfire|accessdate=May 20, 2010}}</ref>

On July 11, Gingrich met with senior Republican leadership to assess the situation. He explained that under no circumstance would he step down. If he was voted out, there would be a new election for Speaker, which would allow for the possibility that Democrats—along with dissenting Republicans—would vote in [[Dick Gephardt]] as Speaker. On July 16, Paxon offered to resign his post, feeling that he had not handled the situation correctly. Paxon was the only unelected member of the leadership group, having been appointed to his position by Gingrich.<ref>{{cite book |title=Lessons Learned the Hard Way |last=Gingrich |first=Newt |year=1998 |publisher=HarperCollins Publishers |isbn=978-0-06-019106-1 |pages=159–160|accessdate=October 19, 2010}}</ref>

In 1998, Boehner was ousted as the chairman of the House Republican Conference, after his party lost five congressional seats.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/02/AR2006020201046.html |title=In an Upset, Boehner Is Elected House GOP Leader |work=The Washington Post |date=March 2, 2006 |accessdate=November 4, 2010 | location=Washington | first=Jonathan | last=Weisman}}</ref>

Following the election of President [[George W. Bush]], Boehner was elected as chairman of the [[U.S. House Committee on Education and the Workforce|House Education and the Workforce Committee]] from 2001 until 2006. There he authored several reforms including the [[Pension Protection Act of 2006|Pension Protection Act]] and a successful school choice voucher program for low-income children in Washington, DC.<ref>{{cite news |author=George F.

===House Republican Leader===
In an upset, Boehner was elected by his colleagues to serve as House Majority Leader on February 2, 2006.  The election followed [[Tom DeLay]]'s resignation from the post after being indicted on criminal charges. Boehner campaigned as a reform candidate who wanted to reform the so-called "[[Earmark (politics)|earmark]]" process and rein in government spending. He defeated Majority Whip [[Roy Blunt]] of [[Missouri]] and Representative [[John Shadegg]] of [[Arizona]], even though he was considered an underdog candidate to Blunt. In the second round of voting by the House Republican Conference, Boehner defeated Blunt with 122 to 109 votes. Blunt kept his previous position as [[Majority Whip]], the No. 3 leadership position in the House. (There was some confusion on the first ballot for Majority Leader as the first count showed one more vote cast than Republicans present,<ref>{{Wayback |date=20060204102043 |url=http://rollcall.com/issues/1_1/breakingnews/12015-1.html |title=Roll Call }}</ref> due to a misunderstanding as to whether the rules allowed Resident Commissioner [[Luis Fortuño]] of Puerto Rico to vote or not).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0602/02/lol.01.html |title=CNN |publisher=CNN |date=February 2, 2006 |accessdate=June 14, 2010}}</ref>

After the Republicans lost control of the House in the 2006 elections, the House Republican Conference chose Boehner as Minority Leader.  While as Majority Leader he was second-in-command behind Speaker [[Dennis Hastert]], as Minority Leader he was the leader of the House Republicans.  As such, he was the Republican nominee for Speaker in 2006 and 2008, losing both times to Pelosi.  While the Speaker is nominally elected by the full House, in practice he or she is almost always chosen by the majority party.

According to the 2008 Congress.org Power Ranking, Boehner was the 6th most powerful congressman (preceded by Speaker Pelosi, Majority Leader Hoyer, Ways and Means Committee Chairman [[Sander M. Levin]], Dean of the House [[John Dingell]], and Appropriations Committee Chairman [[Dave Obey]], all Democrats) and the most powerful Republican.<ref>{{Wayback |date=20080918155340 |url=http://www.congress.org/congressorg/power_rankings/overall.tt }}</ref> As Minority Leader, Boehner served as an ''ex officio'' member of the [[United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence|Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence]].

==Speaker of the House==

The Republicans won a majority in the House of Representatives during the 2010 midterm elections, with a net gain of 63 seats. During his solemn victory speech, Boehner broke into tears when talking about "economic freedom, individual liberty and personal responsibility...I hold these values dear because I've lived them...I've spent my whole life chasing the American Dream".<ref name="Time"/> November 17, 2010, Boehner was unanimously chosen by the House Republicans as their nominee for Speaker,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gopleader.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=215305|title=Boehner: New Leadership "Reflects a New Majority Ready to Listen and Go to Work|publisher=Office of the House Republican Leader|date=November 17, 2010|accessdate=November 19, 2010}}{{dead link|date=June 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/house/129727-boehner-elected-61st-speaker-of-the-house-on-his-61st-birthday|title=Boehner favored as 61st House Speaker on his 61st birthday |publisher=TheHill.com |date=November 17, 2010 |accessdate=November 17, 2010}}</ref> all but assuring his formal election to the post when the new Congress convened with a Republican majority in January 2011.

Boehner appeared on ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'' on January 23, 2014. When asked by Leno if he would ever run for president, the Speaker said no, adding, "I like to play golf. I like to cut my own grass. I do drink red wine, I smoke cigarettes.

==Controversies==

===Connections to lobbyists===
In June 1995, Boehner distributed campaign contributions from [[tobacco industry]] [[lobbyist]]s on the House floor as House members were weighing how to vote on tobacco subsidies.<ref>{{cite news|author=Dana Milbank |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/02/AR2006020202571_pf.html |title=Boehner Makes His Political Comeback |work=Washington Post |date=February 3, 2006 |accessdate=November 22, 2010}}</ref> In a 1996 documentary by [[PBS]] called ''The People and the Power Game'', Boehner said "They asked me to give out a half dozen checks quickly before we got to the end of the month and I complied. And I did it on the House floor, which I regret. I should not have done. It's not a violation of the House rules, but it's a practice that‘s gone on here for a long time that we're trying to stop and I know I'll never do it again."<ref>{{Citation

A September 2010 ''[[New York Times]]'' story said Boehner was "Tightly Bound to Lobbyists" and "He maintains especially tight ties with a circle of lobbyists and former aides representing some of the nation’s biggest businesses, including Goldman Sachs, Google, Citigroup, R.J.

===Smithsonian===
In November 2010, Boehner, along with Minority Whip Eric Cantor, called for the cancellation of an exhibit in the [[Smithsonian]]'s [[National Portrait Gallery (United States)|National Portrait Gallery]] after he learned that it featured a video by [[David Wojnarowicz]], ''A Fire in My Belly'', that contained an image of a [[crucifix]] with ants crawling on it. Boehner spokesman Kevin Smith said, "Smithsonian officials should either acknowledge the mistake and correct it, or be prepared to face tough scrutiny beginning in January when the new majority in the House moves [in]."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/11/30/AR2010113006801.html | work=The Washington Post | first=Jacqueline | last=Trescott | title=Portrait Gallery removes crucifix video from exhibit after complaints | date=December 1, 2010}}</ref>

===Fiscal cliff and Hurricane Sandy relief bill===
On January 1, 2013, after passing the [[fiscal cliff]] [[American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012|deal]], Boehner adjourned the house without passing the $60 million [[Hurricane Sandy relief bill]].

On May 25, 2006, Boehner issued a statement defending his agenda and attacking his "[[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] friends" such as Minority Leader [[Nancy Pelosi]]. Boehner said regarding national security that voters "have a choice between a Republican Party that understands the stakes and is dedicated to victory, and a Democrat Party with a non-existent national security policy that sheepishly dismisses the challenges of a post-[[9/11]] world and is all too willing to concede defeat on the battlefield in [[Iraq]]."
