===Elections===
;2002
After redistricting, Murphy ran for the newly redrawn [[Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district|18th Congressional District]] in [[United States House elections, 2002|2002]]. The district had previously been the 20th, represented by four-term Democrat [[Frank Mascara]]. However, the legislature re-drew the district after the 2000 Census in such a way that a large portion of Mascara's district ended up in the neighboring [[Johnstown, Pennsylvania|Johnstown]]-based 12th District, represented by 28-year incumbent [[John Murtha]]. The new district lines were harshly criticized, in part because in some areas portions of several neighborhoods—and even streets—were split between districts.  In some areas, one side of the street was in the 18th while the other was in the 12th. In the most extreme example, nearly all of Mascara's hometown of [[Charleroi, Pennsylvania|Charleroi]] was drawn into the 12th district, but Mascara's house stayed in the 18th. After a legal battle, the courts largely upheld Pennsylvania's redistricting plan after some minor modifications. Murphy was a member of the committee that redrew Pennsylvania's congressional map, and rumors abounded that he'd reconfigured the district for himself, even though numerous Democrats were also on the committee. Mascara challenged Murtha in the Democratic primary for the 12th District, since the newly configured 12th was geographically more his district than Murtha's. However, Murtha easily defeated Mascara. This removed a significant barrier to Murphy. Even though Democrats outnumbered Republicans by 70,000 registered voters, it was somewhat friendlier to Republicans than the old 20th had been.

Murphy won the Republican primary unopposed and won the general election, defeating Democrat Jack Machek 60%-40%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=1322|title=Our Campaigns - PA District 18 Race - Nov 05, 2002|publisher=}}</ref>

The bill, which passed the House of Representatives on September 29, 2010, received bi-partisan support. The final vote was 348-79. The measure would authorize the [[United States Department of Commerce]] to impose tariffs and countervailing duties against goods from countries with currencies that it deems are undervalued.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/10273/1091424-28.stm | work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | first=Daniel | last=Malloy | title=U.S. House moves against China's undervalued currency | date=September 30, 2010}}</ref> Murphy told WDUQ that the goal is to, “protect domestic manufacturers and the steel industry from countries unwilling to compete fairly in the global marketplace.” He added that by tying China's currency to the dollar and not floating its currency on the open market, China can undercut US manufactures by 40%. In other words, manufacturers in China can make and ship products to the US for less than a manufacturer here can buy the raw materials.<ref name="wduqnews.blogspot.com">{{cite web|last=Nootbaar |first=Mark |url=http://wduqnews.blogspot.com/2010/09/murphy-rallies-for-hr-2378.html |title=Murphy Rallies for HR 2378 |publisher=WDUQ News |date=September 17, 2010 |accessdate=April 10, 2012}}</ref> The Senate failed to take up the legislation, and Murphy reintroduced the bi-partisan measure in February 2011.<ref name="wduqnews.blogspot.com"/>

He won the Republican primary, defeating John Schnatterly 70%-30%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=283588|title=Our Campaigns - Pa State Senate 37  - R Primary Race - Apr 23, 1996|publisher=}}</ref> In the general election, he defeated State Representative [[Greg Fajt]] 55%-45%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=200157|title=Our Campaigns - PA State Senate 37 Race - Nov 05, 1996|publisher=}}</ref> In 2000, he won re-election to a second term, defeating Joseph Rudolph 64%-36%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=37562|title=Our Campaigns - PA State Senate 37 Race - Nov 07, 2000|publisher=}}</ref>

==U.S. House of Representatives (2003–present)==

===Elections===
;2002
After redistricting, Murphy ran for the newly redrawn [[Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district|18th Congressional District]] in [[United States House elections, 2002|2002]]. The district had previously been the 20th, represented by four-term Democrat [[Frank Mascara]]. However, the legislature re-drew the district after the 2000 Census in such a way that a large portion of Mascara's district ended up in the neighboring [[Johnstown, Pennsylvania|Johnstown]]-based 12th District, represented by 28-year incumbent [[John Murtha]]. The new district lines were harshly criticized, in part because in some areas portions of several neighborhoods—and even streets—were split between districts.  In some areas, one side of the street was in the 18th while the other was in the 12th. In the most extreme example, nearly all of Mascara's hometown of [[Charleroi, Pennsylvania|Charleroi]] was drawn into the 12th district, but Mascara's house stayed in the 18th. After a legal battle, the courts largely upheld Pennsylvania's redistricting plan after some minor modifications. Murphy was a member of the committee that redrew Pennsylvania's congressional map, and rumors abounded that he'd reconfigured the district for himself, even though numerous Democrats were also on the committee. Mascara challenged Murtha in the Democratic primary for the 12th District, since the newly configured 12th was geographically more his district than Murtha's. However, Murtha easily defeated Mascara. This removed a significant barrier to Murphy. Even though Democrats outnumbered Republicans by 70,000 registered voters, it was somewhat friendlier to Republicans than the old 20th had been.

Murphy won the Republican primary unopposed and won the general election, defeating Democrat Jack Machek 60%-40%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=1322|title=Our Campaigns - PA District 18 Race - Nov 05, 2002|publisher=}}</ref>

Murphy successfully ran for re-election to a seventh term in the U.S. House in the 2014 election. He was re-nominated unopposed in the Republican primary and was unopposed in the general election, since no candidates filed to run in the Democratic primary.<ref name=2014election/><ref>{{cite news|last1=Cholodofsky|first1=Rich|title=2 Democrats challenge for congressman's seat in 12th District|url=http://triblive.com/state/pennsylvania/5746950-74/primary-republican-district#axzz34doUJUya|accessdate=June 14, 2014|agency=Pittsburgh Tribune Review|date=March 11, 2014}}</ref>

===Tenure===
Murphy lives in [[Upper St. Clair, Pennsylvania|Upper St. Clair]], a suburb of Pittsburgh. However, he is listed on the official House roll as "R-Pittsburgh", although his district does not include any portion of Pittsburgh itself.

On November 26, 2005, Murphy was injured during a traffic accident in [[Iraq]] while riding in a van along with fellow Congressmen [[Jim Marshall (U.S. politician)|Jim Marshall]] and [[Ike Skelton]]. The van swerved off the road to avoid an oncoming vehicle and overturned, injuring Murphy and Skelton. The two were airlifted to [[Ibn Sina Hospital]] in [[Baghdad]].  After an [[MRI]] indicated head and neck injuries, Murphy was flown to the U.S.&nbsp;Military's [[Landstuhl Regional Medical Center]] in [[Germany]] for further tests, which indicated no permanent damage. After wearing a [[neck brace]] for a brief period, Murphy made a full recovery.<ref>[http://today.reuters.com/news/newsarticle.aspx?type=domesticNews&storyid=2005-11-28T130557Z_01_ROB805851_RTRUKOC_0_US-IRAQ-CRASH.xml&rpc=22 "Congressmen involved in Baghdad road accident"], ''Reuters'', November 28, 2005</ref><ref>[http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/05332/613720.stm "Rep.

Murphy was the Republican sponsor of the [[Currency Reform for Fair Trade Act 2010|Currency Reform for Fair Trade Act]], along with Democratic Representative [[Tim Ryan (politician)|Tim Ryan]] of Ohio. The bill, which passed the House of Representatives on September 29, 2010, received bi-partisan support. The final vote was 348-79. The measure would authorize the [[United States Department of Commerce]] to impose tariffs and countervailing duties against goods from countries with currencies that it deems are undervalued.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/10273/1091424-28.stm | work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | first=Daniel | last=Malloy | title=U.S. House moves against China's undervalued currency | date=September 30, 2010}}</ref> Murphy told WDUQ that the goal is to, “protect domestic manufacturers and the steel industry from countries unwilling to compete fairly in the global marketplace.” He added that by tying China's currency to the dollar and not floating its currency on the open market, China can undercut US manufactures by 40%. In other words, manufacturers in China can make and ship products to the US for less than a manufacturer here can buy the raw materials.<ref name="wduqnews.blogspot.com">{{cite web|last=Nootbaar |first=Mark |url=http://wduqnews.blogspot.com/2010/09/murphy-rallies-for-hr-2378.html |title=Murphy Rallies for HR 2378 |publisher=WDUQ News |date=September 17, 2010 |accessdate=April 10, 2012}}</ref> The Senate failed to take up the legislation, and Murphy reintroduced the bi-partisan measure in February 2011.<ref name="wduqnews.blogspot.com"/>

==U.S. House of Representatives (2003–present)==

===Elections===
;2002
After redistricting, Murphy ran for the newly redrawn [[Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district|18th Congressional District]] in [[United States House elections, 2002|2002]]. The district had previously been the 20th, represented by four-term Democrat [[Frank Mascara]]. However, the legislature re-drew the district after the 2000 Census in such a way that a large portion of Mascara's district ended up in the neighboring [[Johnstown, Pennsylvania|Johnstown]]-based 12th District, represented by 28-year incumbent [[John Murtha]]. The new district lines were harshly criticized, in part because in some areas portions of several neighborhoods—and even streets—were split between districts.  In some areas, one side of the street was in the 18th while the other was in the 12th. In the most extreme example, nearly all of Mascara's hometown of [[Charleroi, Pennsylvania|Charleroi]] was drawn into the 12th district, but Mascara's house stayed in the 18th. After a legal battle, the courts largely upheld Pennsylvania's redistricting plan after some minor modifications. Murphy was a member of the committee that redrew Pennsylvania's congressional map, and rumors abounded that he'd reconfigured the district for himself, even though numerous Democrats were also on the committee. Mascara challenged Murtha in the Democratic primary for the 12th District, since the newly configured 12th was geographically more his district than Murtha's. However, Murtha easily defeated Mascara. This removed a significant barrier to Murphy. Even though Democrats outnumbered Republicans by 70,000 registered voters, it was somewhat friendlier to Republicans than the old 20th had been.

Murphy won the Republican primary unopposed and won the general election, defeating Democrat Jack Machek 60%-40%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=1322|title=Our Campaigns - PA District 18 Race - Nov 05, 2002|publisher=}}</ref>

The van swerved off the road to avoid an oncoming vehicle and overturned, injuring Murphy and Skelton. The two were airlifted to [[Ibn Sina Hospital]] in [[Baghdad]].  After an [[MRI]] indicated head and neck injuries, Murphy was flown to the U.S.&nbsp;Military's [[Landstuhl Regional Medical Center]] in [[Germany]] for further tests, which indicated no permanent damage. After wearing a [[neck brace]] for a brief period, Murphy made a full recovery.<ref>[http://today.reuters.com/news/newsarticle.aspx?type=domesticNews&storyid=2005-11-28T130557Z_01_ROB805851_RTRUKOC_0_US-IRAQ-CRASH.xml&rpc=22 "Congressmen involved in Baghdad road accident"], ''Reuters'', November 28, 2005</ref><ref>[http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/05332/613720.stm "Rep.

Murphy was the Republican sponsor of the [[Currency Reform for Fair Trade Act 2010|Currency Reform for Fair Trade Act]], along with Democratic Representative [[Tim Ryan (politician)|Tim Ryan]] of Ohio. The bill, which passed the House of Representatives on September 29, 2010, received bi-partisan support. The final vote was 348-79. The measure would authorize the [[United States Department of Commerce]] to impose tariffs and countervailing duties against goods from countries with currencies that it deems are undervalued.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/10273/1091424-28.stm | work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | first=Daniel | last=Malloy | title=U.S. House moves against China's undervalued currency | date=September 30, 2010}}</ref> Murphy told WDUQ that the goal is to, “protect domestic manufacturers and the steel industry from countries unwilling to compete fairly in the global marketplace.” He added that by tying China's currency to the dollar and not floating its currency on the open market, China can undercut US manufactures by 40%.

==U.S. House of Representatives (2003–present)==

===Elections===
;2002
After redistricting, Murphy ran for the newly redrawn [[Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district|18th Congressional District]] in [[United States House elections, 2002|2002]]. The district had previously been the 20th, represented by four-term Democrat [[Frank Mascara]]. However, the legislature re-drew the district after the 2000 Census in such a way that a large portion of Mascara's district ended up in the neighboring [[Johnstown, Pennsylvania|Johnstown]]-based 12th District, represented by 28-year incumbent [[John Murtha]]. The new district lines were harshly criticized, in part because in some areas portions of several neighborhoods—and even streets—were split between districts.  In some areas, one side of the street was in the 18th while the other was in the 12th. In the most extreme example, nearly all of Mascara's hometown of [[Charleroi, Pennsylvania|Charleroi]] was drawn into the 12th district, but Mascara's house stayed in the 18th. After a legal battle, the courts largely upheld Pennsylvania's redistricting plan after some minor modifications. Murphy was a member of the committee that redrew Pennsylvania's congressional map, and rumors abounded that he'd reconfigured the district for himself, even though numerous Democrats were also on the committee. Mascara challenged Murtha in the Democratic primary for the 12th District, since the newly configured 12th was geographically more his district than Murtha's. However, Murtha easily defeated Mascara. This removed a significant barrier to Murphy. Even though Democrats outnumbered Republicans by 70,000 registered voters, it was somewhat friendlier to Republicans than the old 20th had been.

Murphy won the Republican primary unopposed and won the general election, defeating Democrat Jack Machek 60%-40%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=1322|title=Our Campaigns - PA District 18 Race - Nov 05, 2002|publisher=}}</ref>

===Tenure===
Murphy lives in [[Upper St. Clair, Pennsylvania|Upper St. Clair]], a suburb of Pittsburgh. However, he is listed on the official House roll as "R-Pittsburgh", although his district does not include any portion of Pittsburgh itself.

On November 26, 2005, Murphy was injured during a traffic accident in [[Iraq]] while riding in a van along with fellow Congressmen [[Jim Marshall (U.S. politician)|Jim Marshall]] and [[Ike Skelton]].

After an [[MRI]] indicated head and neck injuries, Murphy was flown to the U.S.&nbsp;Military's [[Landstuhl Regional Medical Center]] in [[Germany]] for further tests, which indicated no permanent damage. After wearing a [[neck brace]] for a brief period, Murphy made a full recovery.<ref>[http://today.reuters.com/news/newsarticle.aspx?type=domesticNews&storyid=2005-11-28T130557Z_01_ROB805851_RTRUKOC_0_US-IRAQ-CRASH.xml&rpc=22 "Congressmen involved in Baghdad road accident"], ''Reuters'', November 28, 2005</ref><ref>[http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/05332/613720.stm "Rep.

Murphy was the Republican sponsor of the [[Currency Reform for Fair Trade Act 2010|Currency Reform for Fair Trade Act]], along with Democratic Representative [[Tim Ryan (politician)|Tim Ryan]] of Ohio. The bill, which passed the House of Representatives on September 29, 2010, received bi-partisan support. The final vote was 348-79. The measure would authorize the [[United States Department of Commerce]] to impose tariffs and countervailing duties against goods from countries with currencies that it deems are undervalued.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/10273/1091424-28.stm | work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | first=Daniel | last=Malloy | title=U.S. House moves against China's undervalued currency | date=September 30, 2010}}</ref> Murphy told WDUQ that the goal is to, “protect domestic manufacturers and the steel industry from countries unwilling to compete fairly in the global marketplace.” He added that by tying China's currency to the dollar and not floating its currency on the open market, China can undercut US manufactures by 40%. In other words, manufacturers in China can make and ship products to the US for less than a manufacturer here can buy the raw materials.<ref name="wduqnews.blogspot.com">{{cite web|last=Nootbaar |first=Mark |url=http://wduqnews.blogspot.com/2010/09/murphy-rallies-for-hr-2378.html |title=Murphy Rallies for HR 2378 |publisher=WDUQ News |date=September 17, 2010 |accessdate=April 10, 2012}}</ref> The Senate failed to take up the legislation, and Murphy reintroduced the bi-partisan measure in February 2011.<ref name="wduqnews.blogspot.com"/>
