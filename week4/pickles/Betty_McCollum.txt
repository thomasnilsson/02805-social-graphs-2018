McCollum advocates shifting America's energy consumption to cleaner, non carbon based sources. McCollum, along with [[Al Franken]], and [[Kit Bond]] presented Congress with the Renewable Energy and Efficiency Act. The plan would utilize thermal energy sources and create renewable energy production tax credits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mccollum.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=994&Itemid= |title=Franken, Bond, McCollum Introduce Thermal Renewable Energy and Efficiency Act |publisher=Mccollum.house.gov |date=July 21, 2010 |accessdate=January 15, 2012}}</ref> She also voted in favor of [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009|American Recovery and Reinvestment]] in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mccollum.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=49&Itemid=77 |title=Energy |publisher=Mccollum.house.gov |date= |accessdate=January 15, 2012}}</ref>

In 2004, McCollum gained national visibility when she and fellow Democrat, [[Jim McDermott]] of [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] called for [[United States Secretary of Education|Secretary of Education]] [[Rod Paige]] to resign for claiming the [[National Education Association]] was "a terrorist organization."

McCollum made headlines in February 2011 when she voted to end military sponsorship of NASCAR teams. The amendment failed 148-241.  She also introduced an amendments in June, 2011 and 2012 to [[Political debates about United States military bands|cut funding for military bands]] by $125 million, a proposal opposed by the [[Fleet Reserve Association]] and described by the [[National Association for Music Education]] as "potentially devastating."<ref>{{cite news |first=Carol Ann |last=Alaimo |title=At Ft.

McCollum opposes Conceal-and-Carry legislation, and in November 2011 she voted against Right-to-Carry reciprocity.<ref name="votesmart1"/>

==Controversies==
On October 5, she omitted the phrase "Under God" from the pledge during a House session. The video of the session quickly became viral and her omission was interpreted as being intentional.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wallbank |first=Derek |url=http://www.minnpost.com/derekwallbank/2010/10/26/22726/mccollum_taking_fire_over_omitting_under_god_in_2002_pledge_of_allegiance |title=D.C.

==Political campaigns==
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Minnesota, 2012#District 4}}
After 4th District Representative [[Bruce Vento]] decided not to seek a 13th term due to illness in 2000 (he died before the election), McCollum won the DFL nomination to succeed him. The district is heavily Democratic (among Minnesota congressional districts, only the neighboring 5th District is considered more Democratic), and Democrats have held the seat since 1949. McCollum's main concern in winning office thus wasn't her [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] opponent, State Senator [[Linda Runbeck]], but [[Independence Party of Minnesota|Independence Party]] candidate Tom Foley. Foley had previously been county attorney for [[Ramsey County, Minnesota|Ramsey County]] (almost all of which is in the 4th District) as a Democrat. Many thought that Foley could siphon off enough votes from McCollum to allow Runbeck to sneak up the middle and end the long run of Democratic dominance in the district. But in the end, McCollum defeated Runbeck by a 17-point margin, with Foley in a distant third place. Foley managed to hold McCollum to 48 percent of the vote, making her the only Democrat not to win at least 50 percent of the vote since Democrats began their present dominance in the district. The district has since reverted to form, and McCollum has been reelected seven times without serious opposition.

In 2008, McCollum endorsed Barack Obama for president.

==Controversies==
On October 5, she omitted the phrase "Under God" from the pledge during a House session. The video of the session quickly became viral and her omission was interpreted as being intentional.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wallbank |first=Derek |url=http://www.minnpost.com/derekwallbank/2010/10/26/22726/mccollum_taking_fire_over_omitting_under_god_in_2002_pledge_of_allegiance |title=D.C.

==Political campaigns==
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Minnesota, 2012#District 4}}
After 4th District Representative [[Bruce Vento]] decided not to seek a 13th term due to illness in 2000 (he died before the election), McCollum won the DFL nomination to succeed him. The district is heavily Democratic (among Minnesota congressional districts, only the neighboring 5th District is considered more Democratic), and Democrats have held the seat since 1949. McCollum's main concern in winning office thus wasn't her [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] opponent, State Senator [[Linda Runbeck]], but [[Independence Party of Minnesota|Independence Party]] candidate Tom Foley. Foley had previously been county attorney for [[Ramsey County, Minnesota|Ramsey County]] (almost all of which is in the 4th District) as a Democrat. Many thought that Foley could siphon off enough votes from McCollum to allow Runbeck to sneak up the middle and end the long run of Democratic dominance in the district. But in the end, McCollum defeated Runbeck by a 17-point margin, with Foley in a distant third place. Foley managed to hold McCollum to 48 percent of the vote, making her the only Democrat not to win at least 50 percent of the vote since Democrats began their present dominance in the district. The district has since reverted to form, and McCollum has been reelected seven times without serious opposition.

In 2008, McCollum endorsed Barack Obama for president.

McCollum made headlines in February 2011 when she voted to end military sponsorship of NASCAR teams. The amendment failed 148-241.  She also introduced an amendments in June, 2011 and 2012 to [[Political debates about United States military bands|cut funding for military bands]] by $125 million, a proposal opposed by the [[Fleet Reserve Association]] and described by the [[National Association for Music Education]] as "potentially devastating."<ref>{{cite news |first=Carol Ann |last=Alaimo |title=At Ft.

After 4th District Representative [[Bruce Vento]] decided not to seek a 13th term due to illness in 2000 (he died before the election), McCollum won the DFL nomination to succeed him. The district is heavily Democratic (among Minnesota congressional districts, only the neighboring 5th District is considered more Democratic), and Democrats have held the seat since 1949. McCollum's main concern in winning office thus wasn't her [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] opponent, State Senator [[Linda Runbeck]], but [[Independence Party of Minnesota|Independence Party]] candidate Tom Foley. Foley had previously been county attorney for [[Ramsey County, Minnesota|Ramsey County]] (almost all of which is in the 4th District) as a Democrat. Many thought that Foley could siphon off enough votes from McCollum to allow Runbeck to sneak up the middle and end the long run of Democratic dominance in the district. But in the end, McCollum defeated Runbeck by a 17-point margin, with Foley in a distant third place. Foley managed to hold McCollum to 48 percent of the vote, making her the only Democrat not to win at least 50 percent of the vote since Democrats began their present dominance in the district. The district has since reverted to form, and McCollum has been reelected seven times without serious opposition.

In 2008, McCollum endorsed Barack Obama for president.

She graduated from the [[College of St. Catherine]] in [[St. Paul, Minnesota]] in 1976. McCollum has worked as a high school social sciences teacher and as a sales manager. She first got involved in politics in 1986, when her daughter got hurt on a slide in a [[North St. Paul, Minnesota|North St. Paul]] city park. When the city council wouldn't do anything to fix the slide, McCollum's neighbors encouraged her to run for a spot on the council herself. She won that November and served three terms.<ref>{{cite web| title = Campaign 2004| publisher = Minnesota Public Radio| url =http://minnesota.publicradio.org/collections/special/2004/campaign/congress/mccollum| accessdate = 2007-02-26}}</ref> She then challenged longtime [[Minnesota House of Representatives|state representative]] Rich O'Conner in the DFL primary and won an upset victory.

In a position paper, Representative McCollum defended her position on Social Security. She stated, "We can secure the future of Social Security with common sense and a shared, bipartisan commitment to economic security and fiscal responsibility for all Americans. This is my commitment, and you can count on me to work to protect Social Security and to find a solution that truly protects the retirement security of every American." <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.votesmart.org/speech_detail.php?sc_id=402196&keyword=&phrase=&contain= |title=Public Statements |publisher=Project Vote Smart |date= |accessdate=January 15, 2012}}</ref>

McCollum advocates shifting America's energy consumption to cleaner, non carbon based sources. McCollum, along with [[Al Franken]], and [[Kit Bond]] presented Congress with the Renewable Energy and Efficiency Act.
