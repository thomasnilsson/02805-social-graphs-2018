'''Timothy Lee''' "'''Tim'''" '''Walberg''' (born April 12, 1951) is the current [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|Michigan|7}}, and was also the former Congressman for the district from 2007 to 2009.

==Early life, education, and early career==

Walberg was born and educated in [[Chicago]], Illinois, the son of Alice Ann and John A. Walberg. His paternal grandparents were Swedish.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~battle/reps/walberg.htm|title=tim walberg|publisher=|accessdate=13 October 2014}}</ref> He left a post-high school position with the [[U.S. Forest Service]] to pursue higher education. At one point working in a steel mill to help pay tuition, he studied forestry at [[Western Illinois University]] and attended [[Moody Bible Institute]], and completed his degree in 1975, when he earned a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in religious education from [[Taylor University]]. By then Walberg was half-way through a four-year stint as a pastor at Grace Fellowship Church in [[New Haven, Indiana]], which concluded when he enrolled in the [[Wheaton College (Illinois)|Wheaton College]] graduate school. After receiving an [[Master of Arts (postgraduate)|M.A.]] in communications in 1978, Walberg and his young family relocated to [[Franklin Township, Lenawee County, Michigan|Tipton, Michigan]], where he led services at Union Gospel Church. He resigned his pastorship in 1982 in preparation for a successful bid for the [[Michigan House of Representatives]].

==Michigan legislature==
Walberg served in the [[Michigan House of Representatives]] from 1983 to 1998. He was succeeded by [[Doug Spade]] and the seat is currently held by [[Dudley Spade]], both Democrats. Walberg also spent time as a pastor and as a division manager for the [[Moody Bible Institute]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]] while continuing to live in Michigan.<ref>[http://www.hillsdale.net/stories/042206//news_2006042200121.shtml Hillsdale.net<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===Elections===
;2004
After six years out of politics, Walberg ran in a field of six candidates in the 2004 Republican primary for the 7th District after six-term incumbent [[Nick Smith (U.S. politician)|Nick Smith]] retired.  He lost to former [[Michigan Senate|State Senator]] [[Joe Schwarz]], a moderate Republican. Schwarz went on to win in November.

;2006
Walberg immediately began gearing up for a rematch against Schwarz in 2006.  Walberg defeated Schwarz in the primary by 3,915 votes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://miboecfr.nictusa.com/election/results/06PRI/06007000.html |title=2006 Official Michigan Primary Election Results - 7th District Representative in Congress 2 Year Term (1) Position |publisher=Miboecfr.nictusa.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref>

The staffer pled guilty to the charges on September 18 and left the campaign after the charges became public in October. Walberg frequently stated the matter was "private" and he hoped the best for the family involved.

Walberg's defeat of Schwarz gave the Democrats hope of winning the seat.  Although Republicans had held it for decades, the 7th is a somewhat marginal district on paper; it narrowly voted for [[Bill Clinton]] in 1992 and 1996 and voted for [[George W. Bush]] almost as narrowly in 2000 and 2004.  On the other hand, Schwarz had won the previous election (against the same Democratic opponent) by 22%.

On November 7, 2006, Walberg defeated Democrat Sharon Renier 50%-46%.<ref>[http://miboecfr.nictusa.com/election/results/06GEN/06007000.html 2006 Official Michigan General Election Results - 7th District Representative in Congress 2 Year Term (1) Position<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The Renier campaign spent $46,000<ref>[http://query.nictusa.com/cgi-bin/dcdev/forms/C00425462/272290/ FEC Disclosure Form 3 for Sharon Renier for Congress<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> to Walberg's $1.2 million<ref>[http://herndon1.sdrdc.com/cgi-bin/cancomsrs/?_06+H4MI07103 FEC Candidate Summary Reports - Candidate ID H4MI07103<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Schauer narrowly defeated Walberg in the November 2008 election. Republican presidential candidate [[John McCain]] lost the district to Democrat [[Barack Obama]] by nearly 17,000 votes but outperformed Walberg by over 6,000 votes, while Walberg lost to Schauer by 7,432 votes.

;Iraq War security comments
In March 2007, Walberg was a guest on the Jack Ebling show on [[WILS]]-AM. During the broadcast Walberg stated that most of Iraq was as stable as [[Detroit, Michigan]] or [[Harvey, Illinois]]. Both the offices of the [[Mayor of Detroit]] and the Mayor of Harvey released statements requesting an apology from Walberg. ''"Unfortunately, for years people have beat up on the city of Detroit. Detroit is the word for negative. We are working very hard to transform that image of our city"'', said James Canning, spokesman for the Detroit office of the Mayor. Mayor Kellogg of Harvey stated: ''"Even though our country appears to have accomplish(ed) great gains in racial harmony, we still have members of congress who suffer from the highest levels of ignorance and stupidity."''<ref>[http://www.lsj.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070322/NEWS01/70322004 ''Lansing State Journal'']

The staffer pled guilty to the charges on September 18 and left the campaign after the charges became public in October. Walberg frequently stated the matter was "private" and he hoped the best for the family involved.

Walberg's defeat of Schwarz gave the Democrats hope of winning the seat.  Although Republicans had held it for decades, the 7th is a somewhat marginal district on paper; it narrowly voted for [[Bill Clinton]] in 1992 and 1996 and voted for [[George W. Bush]] almost as narrowly in 2000 and 2004.  On the other hand, Schwarz had won the previous election (against the same Democratic opponent) by 22%.

On November 7, 2006, Walberg defeated Democrat Sharon Renier 50%-46%.<ref>[http://miboecfr.nictusa.com/election/results/06GEN/06007000.html 2006 Official Michigan General Election Results - 7th District Representative in Congress 2 Year Term (1) Position<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The Renier campaign spent $46,000<ref>[http://query.nictusa.com/cgi-bin/dcdev/forms/C00425462/272290/ FEC Disclosure Form 3 for Sharon Renier for Congress<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> to Walberg's $1.2 million<ref>[http://herndon1.sdrdc.com/cgi-bin/cancomsrs/?_06+H4MI07103 FEC Candidate Summary Reports - Candidate ID H4MI07103<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

;Iraq War security comments
In March 2007, Walberg was a guest on the Jack Ebling show on [[WILS]]-AM. During the broadcast Walberg stated that most of Iraq was as stable as [[Detroit, Michigan]] or [[Harvey, Illinois]]. Both the offices of the [[Mayor of Detroit]] and the Mayor of Harvey released statements requesting an apology from Walberg. ''"Unfortunately, for years people have beat up on the city of Detroit. Detroit is the word for negative. We are working very hard to transform that image of our city"'', said James Canning, spokesman for the Detroit office of the Mayor. Mayor Kellogg of Harvey stated: ''"Even though our country appears to have accomplish(ed) great gains in racial harmony, we still have members of congress who suffer from the highest levels of ignorance and stupidity."''<ref>[http://www.lsj.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070322/NEWS01/70322004 ''Lansing State Journal'']

'''Timothy Lee''' "'''Tim'''" '''Walberg''' (born April 12, 1951) is the current [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|Michigan|7}}, and was also the former Congressman for the district from 2007 to 2009.

==Early life, education, and early career==

Walberg was born and educated in [[Chicago]], Illinois, the son of Alice Ann and John A. Walberg. His paternal grandparents were Swedish.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~battle/reps/walberg.htm|title=tim walberg|publisher=|accessdate=13 October 2014}}</ref> He left a post-high school position with the [[U.S. Forest Service]] to pursue higher education. At one point working in a steel mill to help pay tuition, he studied forestry at [[Western Illinois University]] and attended [[Moody Bible Institute]], and completed his degree in 1975, when he earned a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in religious education from [[Taylor University]]. By then Walberg was half-way through a four-year stint as a pastor at Grace Fellowship Church in [[New Haven, Indiana]], which concluded when he enrolled in the [[Wheaton College (Illinois)|Wheaton College]] graduate school. After receiving an [[Master of Arts (postgraduate)|M.A.]] in communications in 1978, Walberg and his young family relocated to [[Franklin Township, Lenawee County, Michigan|Tipton, Michigan]], where he led services at Union Gospel Church. He resigned his pastorship in 1982 in preparation for a successful bid for the [[Michigan House of Representatives]].

==Michigan legislature==
Walberg served in the [[Michigan House of Representatives]] from 1983 to 1998. He was succeeded by [[Doug Spade]] and the seat is currently held by [[Dudley Spade]], both Democrats. Walberg also spent time as a pastor and as a division manager for the [[Moody Bible Institute]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]] while continuing to live in Michigan.<ref>[http://www.hillsdale.net/stories/042206//news_2006042200121.shtml Hillsdale.net<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

'''Timothy Lee''' "'''Tim'''" '''Walberg''' (born April 12, 1951) is the current [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|Michigan|7}}, and was also the former Congressman for the district from 2007 to 2009.

==Early life, education, and early career==

Walberg was born and educated in [[Chicago]], Illinois, the son of Alice Ann and John A. Walberg. His paternal grandparents were Swedish.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~battle/reps/walberg.htm|title=tim walberg|publisher=|accessdate=13 October 2014}}</ref> He left a post-high school position with the [[U.S. Forest Service]] to pursue higher education. At one point working in a steel mill to help pay tuition, he studied forestry at [[Western Illinois University]] and attended [[Moody Bible Institute]], and completed his degree in 1975, when he earned a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in religious education from [[Taylor University]]. By then Walberg was half-way through a four-year stint as a pastor at Grace Fellowship Church in [[New Haven, Indiana]], which concluded when he enrolled in the [[Wheaton College (Illinois)|Wheaton College]] graduate school. After receiving an [[Master of Arts (postgraduate)|M.A.]] in communications in 1978, Walberg and his young family relocated to [[Franklin Township, Lenawee County, Michigan|Tipton, Michigan]], where he led services at Union Gospel Church. He resigned his pastorship in 1982 in preparation for a successful bid for the [[Michigan House of Representatives]].

==Michigan legislature==
Walberg served in the [[Michigan House of Representatives]] from 1983 to 1998. He was succeeded by [[Doug Spade]] and the seat is currently held by [[Dudley Spade]], both Democrats. Walberg also spent time as a pastor and as a division manager for the [[Moody Bible Institute]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]] while continuing to live in Michigan.<ref>[http://www.hillsdale.net/stories/042206//news_2006042200121.shtml Hillsdale.net<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
;2004
After six years out of politics, Walberg ran in a field of six candidates in the 2004 Republican primary for the 7th District after six-term incumbent [[Nick Smith (U.S. politician)|Nick Smith]] retired.  He lost to former [[Michigan Senate|State Senator]] [[Joe Schwarz]], a moderate Republican. Schwarz went on to win in November.

;2006
Walberg immediately began gearing up for a rematch against Schwarz in 2006.  Walberg defeated Schwarz in the primary by 3,915 votes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://miboecfr.nictusa.com/election/results/06PRI/06007000.html |title=2006 Official Michigan Primary Election Results - 7th District Representative in Congress 2 Year Term (1) Position |publisher=Miboecfr.nictusa.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref>

The staffer pled guilty to the charges on September 18 and left the campaign after the charges became public in October. Walberg frequently stated the matter was "private" and he hoped the best for the family involved.

Walberg's defeat of Schwarz gave the Democrats hope of winning the seat.  Although Republicans had held it for decades, the 7th is a somewhat marginal district on paper; it narrowly voted for [[Bill Clinton]] in 1992 and 1996 and voted for [[George W. Bush]] almost as narrowly in 2000 and 2004.  On the other hand, Schwarz had won the previous election (against the same Democratic opponent) by 22%.

On November 7, 2006, Walberg defeated Democrat Sharon Renier 50%-46%.<ref>[http://miboecfr.nictusa.com/election/results/06GEN/06007000.html 2006 Official Michigan General Election Results - 7th District Representative in Congress 2 Year Term (1) Position<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The Renier campaign spent $46,000<ref>[http://query.nictusa.com/cgi-bin/dcdev/forms/C00425462/272290/ FEC Disclosure Form 3 for Sharon Renier for Congress<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> to Walberg's $1.2 million<ref>[http://herndon1.sdrdc.com/cgi-bin/cancomsrs/?_06+H4MI07103 FEC Candidate Summary Reports - Candidate ID H4MI07103<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
