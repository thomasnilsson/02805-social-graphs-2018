==U.S. House of Representatives (2005-Present)==

===Elections===
;2004
In 2004, U.S. Congressman [[Johnny Isakson]] of [[Georgia's 6th congressional district]] decided not to run for re-election in order to run for the U.S. Senate. No [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] even filed, meaning that whoever won the Republican primary would be virtually assured of being the district's next congressman. The 6th district was so heavily Republican that any Democratic candidate would have faced nearly impossible odds in any event. Six other Republican candidates filed to run, most notably state senators Robert Lamutt and Chuck Clay. Price was the only major candidate from [[Fulton County, Georgia|Fulton County]], while Lamutt and Clay were both from [[Cobb County]]. On July 20, 2004, Price ranked first with 35% of the vote, but failed to reach the 50% threshold needed to win the Republican nomination. Lamutt qualified for the run-off, ranking second with 28% of the vote. Price won two of the district's three counties: [[Fulton County, Georgia|Fulton]] with 63% and [[Cherokee County, Georgia|Cherokee]] with 35%. Lamutt carried [[Cobb County, Georgia|Cobb]] with 31% of the vote.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=4653</ref> In the August 10 run-off election, Price defeated Lamutt 54%-46%. They split the vote in Cherokee, but Price carried Fulton by a landslide of 79% of the vote. Lamutt couldn't eliminate that deficit as he won Cobb with just 59% of the vote.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=114737</ref> Price won the general election unopposed.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=4101</ref>

;2006
In 2006, Price drew one primary challenger, John Konop, who he easily defeated 82%-18%.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=311132</ref> In November, he won re-election to a second term with 72% of the vote.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=206831</ref>

;2008–Present
Price won re-election in 2008 (68%),<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=387947</ref> 2010 (100%),<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=488686</ref> and 2012 (65%).<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=753473</ref>

Tom Price opposes abortion and supported the proposed Protect Life Act, which would have denied [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] (PPACA) funding to health care plans that offered abortion (the PPACA already prevented public funding covering abortions) and allowed hospitals to decline to provide emergency abortion care.<ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/10/13/protect-life-act-passes-house-of-representatives_n_1009876.html Protect Life Act, Controversial Anti-Abortion Bill, Passes House]</ref><ref>http://votesmart.org/public-statement/643441/price-statement-on-the-protect-life-act/?search=abortion</ref> He was rated at 100 by the National Right to Life Center.

However, due to this belief, the [[National Farmers Union (United States)|National Farmers Union]] gave him a 0% approval rate.<ref>http://votesmart.org/candidate/evaluations/11853/tom-price/4</ref>  He supported the Farm Dust Regulation Prevention Act, stating that it would keep the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] from applying too many regulations to farming and ranching.<ref>http://votesmart.org/public-statement/656161/price-statement-on-house-passage-of-farm-dust-regulation-prevention-act/?search=farmers</ref> He also voted for the Agricultural Disaster Assistance Act of 2012 which, had it become law, would have made supplemental agricultural disaster assistance available, if needed.<ref>http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/hr6233</ref><ref>http://votesmart.org/bill/votes/41290</ref>

In 2008 Price signed a pledge sponsored by [[Americans for Prosperity]] promising to vote against any Global Warming legislation that would raise taxes.<ref>http://americansforprosperity.org/noclimatetax//wp-content/uploads/2008/08/price.pdf</ref>

===Legislation===
Price is the sponsor of the [[Empowering Patients First Act]] (EPFA), which he first introduced in the 111th Congress and has reintroduced in each Congress since then. Originally intended to be a Republican alternative to Democratic efforts to reform the health care system, it has since been positioned by Price and other Republicans as a potential replacement to the PPACA. The bill, among other things, creates and expands tax credits for purchasing health insurance, allows for some interstate health insurance markets, and reforms medical malpractice lawsuits.

Price introduced the [[Pro-Growth Budgeting Act of 2013 (H.R. 1874; 113th Congress)]] on May 8, 2013.<ref name=1874sum>{{cite web|title=H.R. 1874 - Summary|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/1874|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=28 March 2014}}</ref> The bill would require the [[Congressional Budget Office]] to provide a macroeconomic impact analysis for bills that are estimated to have a large budgetary effect.<ref name=1874cbo>{{cite web|title=H.R. 1874 - CBO|url=http://cbo.gov/publication/45213|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=28 March 2014}}</ref> Price said it was necessary because the Congressional Budget Office's current method of reviewing bills just to see what they would cost.

In total, Price has sponsored 55 bills, including:<ref>{{cite web|title=Representative Price's Legislation|url=http://www.congress.gov/member/tom-price/1778?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22Price%22%5D%2C%22sponsorship%22%3A%22sponsored%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22bills%22%7D|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=December 11, 2014}}</ref>

==U.S. House of Representatives (2005-Present)==

===Elections===
;2004
In 2004, U.S. Congressman [[Johnny Isakson]] of [[Georgia's 6th congressional district]] decided not to run for re-election in order to run for the U.S. Senate. No [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] even filed, meaning that whoever won the Republican primary would be virtually assured of being the district's next congressman. The 6th district was so heavily Republican that any Democratic candidate would have faced nearly impossible odds in any event. Six other Republican candidates filed to run, most notably state senators Robert Lamutt and Chuck Clay. Price was the only major candidate from [[Fulton County, Georgia|Fulton County]], while Lamutt and Clay were both from [[Cobb County]]. On July 20, 2004, Price ranked first with 35% of the vote, but failed to reach the 50% threshold needed to win the Republican nomination. Lamutt qualified for the run-off, ranking second with 28% of the vote. Price won two of the district's three counties: [[Fulton County, Georgia|Fulton]] with 63% and [[Cherokee County, Georgia|Cherokee]] with 35%. Lamutt carried [[Cobb County, Georgia|Cobb]] with 31% of the vote.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=4653</ref> In the August 10 run-off election, Price defeated Lamutt 54%-46%. They split the vote in Cherokee, but Price carried Fulton by a landslide of 79% of the vote. Lamutt couldn't eliminate that deficit as he won Cobb with just 59% of the vote.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=114737</ref> Price won the general election unopposed.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=4101</ref>

;2006
In 2006, Price drew one primary challenger, John Konop, who he easily defeated 82%-18%.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=311132</ref> In November, he won re-election to a second term with 72% of the vote.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=206831</ref>

;2008–Present
Price won re-election in 2008 (68%),<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=387947</ref> 2010 (100%),<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=488686</ref> and 2012 (65%).<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=753473</ref>

Tom Price opposes abortion and supported the proposed Protect Life Act, which would have denied [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] (PPACA) funding to health care plans that offered abortion (the PPACA already prevented public funding covering abortions) and allowed hospitals to decline to provide emergency abortion care.<ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/10/13/protect-life-act-passes-house-of-representatives_n_1009876.html Protect Life Act, Controversial Anti-Abortion Bill, Passes House]</ref><ref>http://votesmart.org/public-statement/643441/price-statement-on-the-protect-life-act/?search=abortion</ref> He was rated at 100 by the National Right to Life Center.

Chicago]]'', which stated that the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]] applied to the states.<ref>http://votesmart.org/public-statement/529093/supreme-court-reaffirms-second-amendment-rights/?search=second%20amendment</ref> He was given an "A" grade by the National Rifle Association Political Victory Fund, a 92% approval rating overall from the [[National Rifle Association]] and an 83% approval rating<ref name="Project Vote Smart">{{cite web|title=2012 Ratings on Gun Rights - Elected to 113th Congress|url=http://votesmart.org/interest-group/1226/rating/6577#.UWBwZc2FYfw|publisher=Project Vote Smart|accessdate=6 April 2013}}</ref> from the [[Gun Owners of America]], and a 0% approval rating from the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence.<ref name="thehill.com"/><ref>http://votesmart.org/candidate/evaluations/11853/tom-price/37</ref>

Tom Price does not support federal regulation of farming. He has voted against regulating and restricting farmers, earning him a 70% from the [[American Farm Bureau Federation]]. However, due to this belief, the [[National Farmers Union (United States)|National Farmers Union]] gave him a 0% approval rate.<ref>http://votesmart.org/candidate/evaluations/11853/tom-price/4</ref>  He supported the Farm Dust Regulation Prevention Act, stating that it would keep the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] from applying too many regulations to farming and ranching.<ref>http://votesmart.org/public-statement/656161/price-statement-on-house-passage-of-farm-dust-regulation-prevention-act/?search=farmers</ref> He also voted for the Agricultural Disaster Assistance Act of 2012 which, had it become law, would have made supplemental agricultural disaster assistance available, if needed.<ref>http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/hr6233</ref><ref>http://votesmart.org/bill/votes/41290</ref>

In 2008 Price signed a pledge sponsored by [[Americans for Prosperity]] promising to vote against any Global Warming legislation that would raise taxes.<ref>http://americansforprosperity.org/noclimatetax//wp-content/uploads/2008/08/price.pdf</ref>

===Legislation===
Price is the sponsor of the [[Empowering Patients First Act]] (EPFA), which he first introduced in the 111th Congress and has reintroduced in each Congress since then. Originally intended to be a Republican alternative to Democratic efforts to reform the health care system, it has since been positioned by Price and other Republicans as a potential replacement to the PPACA. The bill, among other things, creates and expands tax credits for purchasing health insurance, allows for some interstate health insurance markets, and reforms medical malpractice lawsuits.

Price introduced the [[Pro-Growth Budgeting Act of 2013 (H.R. 1874; 113th Congress)]] on May 8, 2013.<ref name=1874sum>{{cite web|title=H.R. 1874 - Summary|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/1874|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=28 March 2014}}</ref> The bill would require the [[Congressional Budget Office]] to provide a macroeconomic impact analysis for bills that are estimated to have a large budgetary effect.<ref name=1874cbo>{{cite web|title=H.R. 1874 - CBO|url=http://cbo.gov/publication/45213|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=28 March 2014}}</ref> Price said it was necessary because the Congressional Budget Office's current method of reviewing bills just to see what they would cost. Price said "that is a model that has proven to be incapable of providing the type of macroeconomic diagnosis folks need to make sure we are pursuing policies that will help generate economic opportunity and bring down the nation's debt."<ref name=Housepushbudget>{{cite news|last=Kasperowicz|first=Pete|title=House to push budget reforms next week|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/economics-trade/202010-house-to-push-budget-reforms-next-week|accessdate=1 April 2014|newspaper=The Hill|date=28 March 2014}}</ref> H.R. 1874 has passed the House but has yet to become law.

In total, Price has sponsored 55 bills, including:<ref>{{cite web|title=Representative Price's Legislation|url=http://www.congress.gov/member/tom-price/1778?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22Price%22%5D%2C%22sponsorship%22%3A%22sponsored%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22bills%22%7D|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=December 11, 2014}}</ref>

==U.S. House of Representatives (2005-Present)==

===Elections===
;2004
In 2004, U.S. Congressman [[Johnny Isakson]] of [[Georgia's 6th congressional district]] decided not to run for re-election in order to run for the U.S. Senate. No [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] even filed, meaning that whoever won the Republican primary would be virtually assured of being the district's next congressman. The 6th district was so heavily Republican that any Democratic candidate would have faced nearly impossible odds in any event. Six other Republican candidates filed to run, most notably state senators Robert Lamutt and Chuck Clay. Price was the only major candidate from [[Fulton County, Georgia|Fulton County]], while Lamutt and Clay were both from [[Cobb County]]. On July 20, 2004, Price ranked first with 35% of the vote, but failed to reach the 50% threshold needed to win the Republican nomination. Lamutt qualified for the run-off, ranking second with 28% of the vote. Price won two of the district's three counties: [[Fulton County, Georgia|Fulton]] with 63% and [[Cherokee County, Georgia|Cherokee]] with 35%. Lamutt carried [[Cobb County, Georgia|Cobb]] with 31% of the vote.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=4653</ref> In the August 10 run-off election, Price defeated Lamutt 54%-46%. They split the vote in Cherokee, but Price carried Fulton by a landslide of 79% of the vote. Lamutt couldn't eliminate that deficit as he won Cobb with just 59% of the vote.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=114737</ref> Price won the general election unopposed.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=4101</ref>

;2006
In 2006, Price drew one primary challenger, John Konop, who he easily defeated 82%-18%.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=311132</ref> In November, he won re-election to a second term with 72% of the vote.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=206831</ref>

;2008–Present
Price won re-election in 2008 (68%),<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=387947</ref> 2010 (100%),<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=488686</ref> and 2012 (65%).<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=753473</ref>

Tom Price opposes abortion and supported the proposed Protect Life Act, which would have denied [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] (PPACA) funding to health care plans that offered abortion (the PPACA already prevented public funding covering abortions) and allowed hospitals to decline to provide emergency abortion care.<ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/10/13/protect-life-act-passes-house-of-representatives_n_1009876.html Protect Life Act, Controversial Anti-Abortion Bill, Passes House]</ref><ref>http://votesmart.org/public-statement/643441/price-statement-on-the-protect-life-act/?search=abortion</ref> He was rated at 100 by the National Right to Life Center.

Tom Price opposes [[gun control]]. He praised the Supreme Court's decisions in ''[[District of Columbia v. Heller]]'', which found that the  absolute prohibition of handguns in the District of Columbia was unconstitutional, and ''[[McDonald v. Chicago]]'', which stated that the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]] applied to the states.<ref>http://votesmart.org/public-statement/529093/supreme-court-reaffirms-second-amendment-rights/?search=second%20amendment</ref> He was given an "A" grade by the National Rifle Association Political Victory Fund, a 92% approval rating overall from the [[National Rifle Association]] and an 83% approval rating<ref name="Project Vote Smart">{{cite web|title=2012 Ratings on Gun Rights - Elected to 113th Congress|url=http://votesmart.org/interest-group/1226/rating/6577#.UWBwZc2FYfw|publisher=Project Vote Smart|accessdate=6 April 2013}}</ref> from the [[Gun Owners of America]], and a 0% approval rating from the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence.<ref name="thehill.com"/><ref>http://votesmart.org/candidate/evaluations/11853/tom-price/37</ref>

He receives a 0% rating by the [[Human Rights Campaign]], a gay rights organization.<ref>http://www.ontheissues.org/GA/Tom_Price.htm</ref>

Tom Price does not support federal regulation of farming. He has voted against regulating and restricting farmers, earning him a 70% from the [[American Farm Bureau Federation]]. However, due to this belief, the [[National Farmers Union (United States)|National Farmers Union]] gave him a 0% approval rate.<ref>http://votesmart.org/candidate/evaluations/11853/tom-price/4</ref>  He supported the Farm Dust Regulation Prevention Act, stating that it would keep the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] from applying too many regulations to farming and ranching.<ref>http://votesmart.org/public-statement/656161/price-statement-on-house-passage-of-farm-dust-regulation-prevention-act/?search=farmers</ref> He also voted for the Agricultural Disaster Assistance Act of 2012 which, had it become law, would have made supplemental agricultural disaster assistance available, if needed.<ref>http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/hr6233</ref><ref>http://votesmart.org/bill/votes/41290</ref>

In 2008 Price signed a pledge sponsored by [[Americans for Prosperity]] promising to vote against any Global Warming legislation that would raise taxes.<ref>http://americansforprosperity.org/noclimatetax//wp-content/uploads/2008/08/price.pdf</ref>

===Legislation===
Price is the sponsor of the [[Empowering Patients First Act]] (EPFA), which he first introduced in the 111th Congress and has reintroduced in each Congress since then. Originally intended to be a Republican alternative to Democratic efforts to reform the health care system, it has since been positioned by Price and other Republicans as a potential replacement to the PPACA. The bill, among other things, creates and expands tax credits for purchasing health insurance, allows for some interstate health insurance markets, and reforms medical malpractice lawsuits.

Price introduced the [[Pro-Growth Budgeting Act of 2013 (H.R. 1874; 113th Congress)]] on May 8, 2013.<ref name=1874sum>{{cite web|title=H.R. 1874 - Summary|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/1874|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=28 March 2014}}</ref> The bill would require the [[Congressional Budget Office]] to provide a macroeconomic impact analysis for bills that are estimated to have a large budgetary effect.<ref name=1874cbo>{{cite web|title=H.R. 1874 - CBO|url=http://cbo.gov/publication/45213|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=28 March 2014}}</ref> Price said it was necessary because the Congressional Budget Office's current method of reviewing bills just to see what they would cost. Price said "that is a model that has proven to be incapable of providing the type of macroeconomic diagnosis folks need to make sure we are pursuing policies that will help generate economic opportunity and bring down the nation's debt."<ref name=Housepushbudget>{{cite news|last=Kasperowicz|first=Pete|title=House to push budget reforms next week|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/economics-trade/202010-house-to-push-budget-reforms-next-week|accessdate=1 April 2014|newspaper=The Hill|date=28 March 2014}}</ref> H.R. 1874 has passed the House but has yet to become law.

In total, Price has sponsored 55 bills, including:<ref>{{cite web|title=Representative Price's Legislation|url=http://www.congress.gov/member/tom-price/1778?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22Price%22%5D%2C%22sponsorship%22%3A%22sponsored%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22bills%22%7D|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=December 11, 2014}}</ref>

==U.S. House of Representatives (2005-Present)==

===Elections===
;2004
In 2004, U.S. Congressman [[Johnny Isakson]] of [[Georgia's 6th congressional district]] decided not to run for re-election in order to run for the U.S. Senate. No [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] even filed, meaning that whoever won the Republican primary would be virtually assured of being the district's next congressman. The 6th district was so heavily Republican that any Democratic candidate would have faced nearly impossible odds in any event. Six other Republican candidates filed to run, most notably state senators Robert Lamutt and Chuck Clay. Price was the only major candidate from [[Fulton County, Georgia|Fulton County]], while Lamutt and Clay were both from [[Cobb County]]. On July 20, 2004, Price ranked first with 35% of the vote, but failed to reach the 50% threshold needed to win the Republican nomination. Lamutt qualified for the run-off, ranking second with 28% of the vote. Price won two of the district's three counties: [[Fulton County, Georgia|Fulton]] with 63% and [[Cherokee County, Georgia|Cherokee]] with 35%. Lamutt carried [[Cobb County, Georgia|Cobb]] with 31% of the vote.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=4653</ref> In the August 10 run-off election, Price defeated Lamutt 54%-46%. They split the vote in Cherokee, but Price carried Fulton by a landslide of 79% of the vote. Lamutt couldn't eliminate that deficit as he won Cobb with just 59% of the vote.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=114737</ref> Price won the general election unopposed.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=4101</ref>

;2006
In 2006, Price drew one primary challenger, John Konop, who he easily defeated 82%-18%.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=311132</ref> In November, he won re-election to a second term with 72% of the vote.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=206831</ref>

;2008–Present
Price won re-election in 2008 (68%),<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=387947</ref> 2010 (100%),<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=488686</ref> and 2012 (65%).<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=753473</ref>

Tom Price opposes abortion and supported the proposed Protect Life Act, which would have denied [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] (PPACA) funding to health care plans that offered abortion (the PPACA already prevented public funding covering abortions) and allowed hospitals to decline to provide emergency abortion care.<ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/10/13/protect-life-act-passes-house-of-representatives_n_1009876.html Protect Life Act, Controversial Anti-Abortion Bill, Passes House]</ref><ref>http://votesmart.org/public-statement/643441/price-statement-on-the-protect-life-act/?search=abortion</ref> He was rated at 100 by the National Right to Life Center.

Tom Price opposes [[gun control]]. He praised the Supreme Court's decisions in ''[[District of Columbia v.

Chicago]]'', which stated that the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]] applied to the states.<ref>http://votesmart.org/public-statement/529093/supreme-court-reaffirms-second-amendment-rights/?search=second%20amendment</ref> He was given an "A" grade by the National Rifle Association Political Victory Fund, a 92% approval rating overall from the [[National Rifle Association]] and an 83% approval rating<ref name="Project Vote Smart">{{cite web|title=2012 Ratings on Gun Rights - Elected to 113th Congress|url=http://votesmart.org/interest-group/1226/rating/6577#.UWBwZc2FYfw|publisher=Project Vote Smart|accessdate=6 April 2013}}</ref> from the [[Gun Owners of America]], and a 0% approval rating from the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence.<ref name="thehill.com"/><ref>http://votesmart.org/candidate/evaluations/11853/tom-price/37</ref>

In 2008 Price signed a pledge sponsored by [[Americans for Prosperity]] promising to vote against any Global Warming legislation that would raise taxes.<ref>http://americansforprosperity.org/noclimatetax//wp-content/uploads/2008/08/price.pdf</ref>

===Legislation===
Price is the sponsor of the [[Empowering Patients First Act]] (EPFA), which he first introduced in the 111th Congress and has reintroduced in each Congress since then. Originally intended to be a Republican alternative to Democratic efforts to reform the health care system, it has since been positioned by Price and other Republicans as a potential replacement to the PPACA. The bill, among other things, creates and expands tax credits for purchasing health insurance, allows for some interstate health insurance markets, and reforms medical malpractice lawsuits.

Price introduced the [[Pro-Growth Budgeting Act of 2013 (H.R. 1874; 113th Congress)]] on May 8, 2013.<ref name=1874sum>{{cite web|title=H.R. 1874 - Summary|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/1874|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=28 March 2014}}</ref> The bill would require the [[Congressional Budget Office]] to provide a macroeconomic impact analysis for bills that are estimated to have a large budgetary effect.<ref name=1874cbo>{{cite web|title=H.R. 1874 - CBO|url=http://cbo.gov/publication/45213|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=28 March 2014}}</ref> Price said it was necessary because the Congressional Budget Office's current method of reviewing bills just to see what they would cost. Price said "that is a model that has proven to be incapable of providing the type of macroeconomic diagnosis folks need to make sure we are pursuing policies that will help generate economic opportunity and bring down the nation's debt."<ref name=Housepushbudget>{{cite news|last=Kasperowicz|first=Pete|title=House to push budget reforms next week|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/economics-trade/202010-house-to-push-budget-reforms-next-week|accessdate=1 April 2014|newspaper=The Hill|date=28 March 2014}}</ref> H.R. 1874 has passed the House but has yet to become law.

In total, Price has sponsored 55 bills, including:<ref>{{cite web|title=Representative Price's Legislation|url=http://www.congress.gov/member/tom-price/1778?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22Price%22%5D%2C%22sponsorship%22%3A%22sponsored%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22bills%22%7D|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=December 11, 2014}}</ref>
