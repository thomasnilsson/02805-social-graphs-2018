Bass was criticized{{By whom|date=October 2013}} for the following statement to [[Los Angeles Times]] reporter [[Patt Morrison]]: "The Republicans were essentially threatened and terrorized against voting for revenue. Now [some] are facing recalls. They operate under a terrorist threat: 'You vote for revenue and your career is over.' I don't know why we allow that kind of terrorism to exist. I guess it's about free speech, but it's extremely unfair."<ref>{{cite news

===Guns===
Bass is a very strong supporter of gun control. The National Rifle Association Political Victory Fund Lifetime Score is an F. The Gun Owners of California Postitons on Gun Rights have also given Bass an F. Congresswoman Bass recently has voted against the National Right-to-Carry Reciprocity Act that would loosen general Gun Control laws.

===International Policy/Foreign Affairs===
Bass serves in the Committee on Foreign Affairs. In her website, she supports “working with our NATO allies and within the United Nations”. She also attributes significant importance to diplomacy and “creat[ing] jobs here in the US”. Bass does so through supporting trade protectionism. She has voted against the Free Trade Treaty with South Korea and the Trade Promotion Agreements with Colombia and Panama. She has not yet been rated by different interest groups because congresswoman Bass has served for less than one year in the house of Representatives.<ref name="votesmart" /><ref>{{cite web|title=Foreign Policy|publisher=Karen Bass|url=http://karenbass.house.gov/issue/foreign-policy|accessdate=2014-02-15}}</ref>

===The Budget, Taxes and Spending===
Bass, a social liberal, with Ratings around 100% by pro-gay marriage associations, can also be considered so in her fiscal positions. She has a rating of 10% from the very conservative California Tax Payers Association. However, the more liberal Consumer Federation of California gives her very high rankings. Besides the following positions on Taxing and Spending, She supports stimulus to create jobs.

Bass has been against general Budget-Wide Cuts like Resolution 38 which would reduce spending to 2008 levels. She has also opposed budgets with deep cuts like the 2011 Budget. However, she has supported the H Amendment 16 for Reducing Navy and Air Force Appropriations. She has supported mainly military cuts.

Bass has supported keeping taxes low for the middle class and “tax credits for small businesses to hire new employees”. She states that the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest should expire because “the wealthy…don’t need these breaks”.<ref name="votesmart" /><ref>{{cite web|title=Jobs & the Economy|publisher=Karen Bass|url=http://bass.house.gov/issue/economy|accessdate=2014-02-15}}</ref>

Bass was criticized{{By whom|date=October 2013}} for the following statement to [[Los Angeles Times]] reporter [[Patt Morrison]]: "The Republicans were essentially threatened and terrorized against voting for revenue. Now [some] are facing recalls. They operate under a terrorist threat: 'You vote for revenue and your career is over.' I don't know why we allow that kind of terrorism to exist. I guess it's about free speech, but it's extremely unfair."<ref>{{cite news

===International Policy/Foreign Affairs===
Bass serves in the Committee on Foreign Affairs. In her website, she supports “working with our NATO allies and within the United Nations”.

She has voted against the Free Trade Treaty with South Korea and the Trade Promotion Agreements with Colombia and Panama. She has not yet been rated by different interest groups because congresswoman Bass has served for less than one year in the house of Representatives.<ref name="votesmart" /><ref>{{cite web|title=Foreign Policy|publisher=Karen Bass|url=http://karenbass.house.gov/issue/foreign-policy|accessdate=2014-02-15}}</ref>

Bass, a social liberal, with Ratings around 100% by pro-gay marriage associations, can also be considered so in her fiscal positions. She has a rating of 10% from the very conservative California Tax Payers Association. However, the more liberal Consumer Federation of California gives her very high rankings. Besides the following positions on Taxing and Spending, She supports stimulus to create jobs.

Bass has been against general Budget-Wide Cuts like Resolution 38 which would reduce spending to 2008 levels. She has also opposed budgets with deep cuts like the 2011 Budget. However, she has supported the H Amendment 16 for Reducing Navy and Air Force Appropriations. She has supported mainly military cuts.

Bass has supported keeping taxes low for the middle class and “tax credits for small businesses to hire new employees”. She states that the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest should expire because “the wealthy…don’t need these breaks”.<ref name="votesmart" /><ref>{{cite web|title=Jobs & the Economy|publisher=Karen Bass|url=http://bass.house.gov/issue/economy|accessdate=2014-02-15}}</ref>

===Speakership===

Bass was criticized{{By whom|date=October 2013}} for the following statement to [[Los Angeles Times]] reporter [[Patt Morrison]]: "The Republicans were essentially threatened and terrorized against voting for revenue. Now [some] are facing recalls. They operate under a terrorist threat: 'You vote for revenue and your career is over.' I don't know why we allow that kind of terrorism to exist. I guess it's about free speech, but it's extremely unfair."<ref>{{cite news

===Guns===
Bass is a very strong supporter of gun control. The National Rifle Association Political Victory Fund Lifetime Score is an F.

===International Policy/Foreign Affairs===
Bass serves in the Committee on Foreign Affairs. In her website, she supports “working with our NATO allies and within the United Nations”. She also attributes significant importance to diplomacy and “creat[ing] jobs here in the US”. Bass does so through supporting trade protectionism. She has voted against the Free Trade Treaty with South Korea and the Trade Promotion Agreements with Colombia and Panama. She has not yet been rated by different interest groups because congresswoman Bass has served for less than one year in the house of Representatives.<ref name="votesmart" /><ref>{{cite web|title=Foreign Policy|publisher=Karen Bass|url=http://karenbass.house.gov/issue/foreign-policy|accessdate=2014-02-15}}</ref>

Bass, a social liberal, with Ratings around 100% by pro-gay marriage associations, can also be considered so in her fiscal positions. She has a rating of 10% from the very conservative California Tax Payers Association. However, the more liberal Consumer Federation of California gives her very high rankings. Besides the following positions on Taxing and Spending, She supports stimulus to create jobs.

Bass has been against general Budget-Wide Cuts like Resolution 38 which would reduce spending to 2008 levels. She has also opposed budgets with deep cuts like the 2011 Budget. However, she has supported the H Amendment 16 for Reducing Navy and Air Force Appropriations. She has supported mainly military cuts.

Bass has supported keeping taxes low for the middle class and “tax credits for small businesses to hire new employees”. She states that the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest should expire because “the wealthy…don’t need these breaks”.<ref name="votesmart" /><ref>{{cite web|title=Jobs & the Economy|publisher=Karen Bass|url=http://bass.house.gov/issue/economy|accessdate=2014-02-15}}</ref>

With the defeat of [[California Proposition 93 (2008)|Proposition 93]], Speaker [[Fabian Núñez]] was termed out of the Assembly at the end of the 2007-2008 session. As the next-highest-ranking Democrat in the Assembly, Bass was well-positioned to take the post.  After consolidating the support of a number of Legislators who had previously also been seeking the Speakership, Bass was elected Speaker on February 28, 2008 and then sworn in as Speaker on May 13.<ref>{{cite news |first=Matthew |last=Yi |title=L.A. lawmaker first African American woman to lead state Assembly |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/02/29/BASPVASI5.DTL |work=[[The San Francisco Chronicle]] |date=29 February 2008 |accessdate=2008-03-01}}</ref>

Bass was criticized{{By whom|date=October 2013}} for the following statement to [[Los Angeles Times]] reporter [[Patt Morrison]]: "The Republicans were essentially threatened and terrorized against voting for revenue. Now [some] are facing recalls. They operate under a terrorist threat: 'You vote for revenue and your career is over.' I don't know why we allow that kind of terrorism to exist. I guess it's about free speech, but it's extremely unfair."<ref>{{cite news
