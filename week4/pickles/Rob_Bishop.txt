In May 2010 Rob Bishop joined with other conservative House members to launch the 10th Amendment Task Force.  The Task Force aims to educate Congress and the public about the concept of [[Federalism in the United States|Federalism]].

As a [[Member of Congress]], Rob Bishop has introduced legislation to increase domestic energy production in the United States, such as the 3-D energy bill.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vitter.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=PressRoom.PressReleases&ContentRecord_id=0d2fa4cb-d070-30a2-9b68-20822d50d0e5|title=Vitter, Bishop Introduce Bicameral 3D Act|accessdate=5 July 2011|date=31 March 2011}}</ref> Ever a proponent of [[Multiple use]] parks over single use parks, he leveraged his position as Chairman of the Subcommittee over National Parks, Forests and Public Lands to stop the Department of Interior from designating areas as new defacto wilderness areas known as Wild Lands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://robbishop.house.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=244124|title=Bishop Responds to DOI Memo Calling for a Halt on Wild Lands Designations}}</ref>

In February 2011, Bishop introduced an amendment during the debate on a continuing [[budget resolution]] for fiscal year 2011 that would have prohibited the [[Bureau of Land Management]] (BLM) from spending federal funds on the [[National Landscape Conservation System]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://robbishop.house.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=225394|title=Bishop Introduces Amendment to Defund National Landscape Conservation System|date=16 February 2011|accessdate=5 July 2011}}</ref> After coming under fire for introducing this amendment,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/705366847/Groups-blast-Bishop-over-gutting-landscape-conservation.html|title=Groups blast Bishop over 'gutting' landscape conservation|accessdate=5 July 2011|date=16 February 2011|publisher=Deseret News}}</ref> Bishop withdrew it before the continuing budget resolution was voted on.

In mid-2011, after touring of the U.S. Mexico border, Rob Bishop led the charge on introducing a border security bill, H.R. 1505 the National Security and Federal Lands Protection Act. This bill gives the U.S. Border Patrol the authority to override specific environmental laws in order to allow the U.S. Border Patrol greater access to some of the most highly trafficked areas along the border. U.S. Border Patrol agents have cited that their efforts to address rampant criminal activity along the border have been hampered by [http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/story/2011-10-27/border-patrol-environmental-laws/50952930/1 environmental laws]. The bill passed the House Natural Resources Committee and has not yet been brought before the full U.S. House of Representatives for a vote.

Similarly Congressman Bishop co-sponsored a bill put forth by House Majority whip [[Kevin McCarthy (California politician)|Kevin McCarthy]] to remove regulations from {{convert|43|e6acre|km2}} of Forest Service Roadless Areas and Wilderness Study Areas to multiple use purposes.

In 2013 Congressman Bishop announced the establishment of the Utah Public Lands Initiative.<ref name="Businesses, council respond to Public Lands Initiative">{{cite news|last=Millis|first=Kristin|title=Managing Editor|url=http://www.moabsunnews.com/news/article_d744265e-c22c-11e2-ae84-0019bb30f31a.html|accessdate=April 28, 2014|newspaper=Moab Sun News|date=May 22, 2013}}</ref> According to a staff report<ref name="PLI Staff Report">{{cite web|title=Public Lands Initiative Staff Report|url=http://robbishop.house.gov/uploadedfiles/pli_staff_report_112013.pdf|work=Staff Report|publisher=Offices of Rob Bishop, Jason Chaffetz, and Chris Stewart|accessdate=April 28, 2014}}</ref> prepared by the offices of [http://robbishop.house.gov/ Congressman Rob Bishop], [[Jason Chaffetz|Congressman Jason Chaffetz]], and [[Chris Stewart (politician)|Congressman Chris Stewart]], the Utah Public Lands Initiative is a locally driven initiative to bring resolution to some of the most challenging land disputes in the State of Utah.

===Legislation===
On April 10, 2013, Bishop introduced the [[Ensuring Public Involvement in the Creation of National Monuments Act (H.R. 1459; 113th Congress)]]. The bill would amend the [[Antiquities Act of 1906]] to subject [[National Monument (United States)|national monument]] declarations by the President to the [[National Environmental Policy Act of 1969]] (NEPA).<ref name=1459sum>{{cite web|title=H.R. 1459 - Summary|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/1459|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=24 March 2014}}</ref> At present, the [[President of the United States]] can unilaterally declare something a national monument, whereas the [[United States Congress]] is required to follow a more rigorous series of procedures to gather input from the public.<ref name=IBTjohanson>{{cite news|last=Johanson|first=Mark|title=GOP Bill Could Mean 'No More National Parks,' Public Land Advocates Warn|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/gop-bill-could-mean-no-more-national-parks-public-land-advocates-warn-1563152|accessdate=24 March 2014|newspaper=International Business Times|date=24 March 2014}}</ref> 

In addition to limiting the number of national monument declarations the president could make, the bill would forbid the government from declaring land belonging to a private owner as a national monument without the private owner's consent.<ref name="1459sum"/> Bishop argued that "the American people deserve the opportunity to participate in land-use decisions regardless of whether they are made in Congress or by the President". He claims his new bill would ensure "that new national monuments are created openly with consideration of public input".<ref name="IBTjohanson"/>

In addition to limiting the number of national monument declarations the president could make, the bill would forbid the government from declaring land belonging to a private owner as a national monument without the private owner's consent.<ref name="1459sum"/> Bishop argued that "the American people deserve the opportunity to participate in land-use decisions regardless of whether they are made in Congress or by the President".

==Early life, education, and early career==
Rob Bishop was born in [[Kaysville, Utah]] and graduated from Davis High School. He served as a [[Mormon missionary]] in Germany from 1970 until 1972. Bishop received a bachelor's degree in political science from the [[University of Utah]] in [[Salt Lake City]] in 1974.  He taught civics classes at Brigham City's [http://www.behs.besd.net/ Box Elder High School] from 1974 to 1980; he next taught German in [[Ogden, Utah]] at [[Ben Lomond High School]]; then he returned to teaching government and history classes at Box Elder High School until his retirement from teaching in 2002. [http://robbishop.house.gov/Biography/] While a teacher at Box Elder, Bishop partnered with the [[Close Up Foundation]] to help students participate in Close Up's Washington, DC based civic education programs. He remains actively involved in the program and works to ensure that Utah students have the opportunity to visit Washington, D.C.

==Early political career==
Bishop was a member of the Utah State House of Representatives.  He was House Majority Leader and later served as Speaker of the House from 1992 until 1994.  In 1997 he was elected chairman of the [[Utah Republican Party]], and served for two terms in this position. He has also worked as a legislative lobbyist in Washington.  After his retirement from the state legislature, Bishop returned to Box Elder High School and taught advanced placement courses while chairing the history department.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
In 2002, he was elected with 61% of the vote. He has won re-election in 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010, and 2012 with even larger margins. In 2014, he was reelected with 64% of the vote.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Fahys|first1=Judy|title=Replican Bishop Returns to Congress in 1st District|url=http://kuer.org/post/republican-bishop-returns-congress-1st-district|accessdate=20 November 2014|agency=KUER 90.1|publisher=NPR|date=5 November 2014}}</ref>

===Tenure===
As a teacher, he has made education related issues a top priority. He is a strong advocate for increased local control of schools.  He opposes [[No Child Left Behind]] and supports [[school vouchers]]. He was also a co-sponsor of a proposed amendment to guarantee a balanced federal budget.

From 2008-2010 Rob Bishop served as Chairman of the [[Congressional Western Caucus]], where he advocated for multiple use of public lands and the need for fewer restrictions and mandates that limit use.

In May 2010 Rob Bishop joined with other conservative House members to launch the 10th Amendment Task Force.  The Task Force aims to educate Congress and the public about the concept of [[Federalism in the United States|Federalism]].

As a [[Member of Congress]], Rob Bishop has introduced legislation to increase domestic energy production in the United States, such as the 3-D energy bill.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vitter.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=PressRoom.PressReleases&ContentRecord_id=0d2fa4cb-d070-30a2-9b68-20822d50d0e5|title=Vitter, Bishop Introduce Bicameral 3D Act|accessdate=5 July 2011|date=31 March 2011}}</ref> Ever a proponent of [[Multiple use]] parks over single use parks, he leveraged his position as Chairman of the Subcommittee over National Parks, Forests and Public Lands to stop the Department of Interior from designating areas as new defacto wilderness areas known as Wild Lands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://robbishop.house.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=244124|title=Bishop Responds to DOI Memo Calling for a Halt on Wild Lands Designations}}</ref>

In February 2011, Bishop introduced an amendment during the debate on a continuing [[budget resolution]] for fiscal year 2011 that would have prohibited the [[Bureau of Land Management]] (BLM) from spending federal funds on the [[National Landscape Conservation System]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://robbishop.house.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=225394|title=Bishop Introduces Amendment to Defund National Landscape Conservation System|date=16 February 2011|accessdate=5 July 2011}}</ref> After coming under fire for introducing this amendment,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/705366847/Groups-blast-Bishop-over-gutting-landscape-conservation.html|title=Groups blast Bishop over 'gutting' landscape conservation|accessdate=5 July 2011|date=16 February 2011|publisher=Deseret News}}</ref> Bishop withdrew it before the continuing budget resolution was voted on.

In mid-2011, after touring of the U.S. Mexico border, Rob Bishop led the charge on introducing a border security bill, H.R. 1505 the National Security and Federal Lands Protection Act. This bill gives the U.S. Border Patrol the authority to override specific environmental laws in order to allow the U.S. Border Patrol greater access to some of the most highly trafficked areas along the border. U.S. Border Patrol agents have cited that their efforts to address rampant criminal activity along the border have been hampered by [http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/story/2011-10-27/border-patrol-environmental-laws/50952930/1 environmental laws]. The bill passed the House Natural Resources Committee and has not yet been brought before the full U.S. House of Representatives for a vote.

Similarly Congressman Bishop co-sponsored a bill put forth by House Majority whip [[Kevin McCarthy (California politician)|Kevin McCarthy]] to remove regulations from {{convert|43|e6acre|km2}} of Forest Service Roadless Areas and Wilderness Study Areas to multiple use purposes.

Well known for his fashionable three piece suits, Congressman Bishop became the third best dressed congressmen in 2012 according to an article written in the Washingtonian.<ref>{{cite news|last=Burr|first=Thomas|title=News roundup: Bishop third-best dressed in Congress|url=http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/blogsoutofcontext/55369233-64/congress-obama-rep-romney.html.csp|accessdate=2012-12-27|newspaper=Salt Lake Tribune|date=November 29, 2012}}</ref>

In 2013 Congressman Bishop announced the establishment of the Utah Public Lands Initiative.<ref name="Businesses, council respond to Public Lands Initiative">{{cite news|last=Millis|first=Kristin|title=Managing Editor|url=http://www.moabsunnews.com/news/article_d744265e-c22c-11e2-ae84-0019bb30f31a.html|accessdate=April 28, 2014|newspaper=Moab Sun News|date=May 22, 2013}}</ref> According to a staff report<ref name="PLI Staff Report">{{cite web|title=Public Lands Initiative Staff Report|url=http://robbishop.house.gov/uploadedfiles/pli_staff_report_112013.pdf|work=Staff Report|publisher=Offices of Rob Bishop, Jason Chaffetz, and Chris Stewart|accessdate=April 28, 2014}}</ref> prepared by the offices of [http://robbishop.house.gov/ Congressman Rob Bishop], [[Jason Chaffetz|Congressman Jason Chaffetz]], and [[Chris Stewart (politician)|Congressman Chris Stewart]], the Utah Public Lands Initiative is a locally driven initiative to bring resolution to some of the most challenging land disputes in the State of Utah. The initiative is rooted in the believe that conservation and economic development can coexist to make Utah a better place to live, work, and visit.<ref>http://robbishop.house.gov/uploadedfiles/pli_staff_report_112013.pdf</ref>

In February 2014 House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Doc Hastings announced that he will retire at the close of the 113th Congress.<ref name="Rep. Doc Hastings (R-Wash) to retire">{{cite news|last=Blake|first=Aaron|title=Author|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2014/02/13/rep-doc-hastings-r-wash-to-retire/|accessdate=February 13, 2014|newspaper=Washington Post|date=February 13, 2014}}</ref> Congressman Bishop is rumored to be a top contender for the Chairmanship.<ref name="Bishop rumored to be under consideration for Chairmanship">{{cite news|last=Burr|first=Thomas|title=Author|url=http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/politics/57682376-90/bishop-chaffetz-chairman-chairmanships.html.csp|accessdate=March 17, 2014|newspaper=Salt Lake Tribune|date=March 17, 2014}}</ref>

===Legislation===
On April 10, 2013, Bishop introduced the [[Ensuring Public Involvement in the Creation of National Monuments Act (H.R. 1459; 113th Congress)]]. The bill would amend the [[Antiquities Act of 1906]] to subject [[National Monument (United States)|national monument]] declarations by the President to the [[National Environmental Policy Act of 1969]] (NEPA).<ref name=1459sum>{{cite web|title=H.R. 1459 - Summary|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/1459|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=24 March 2014}}</ref> At present, the [[President of the United States]] can unilaterally declare something a national monument, whereas the [[United States Congress]] is required to follow a more rigorous series of procedures to gather input from the public.<ref name=IBTjohanson>{{cite news|last=Johanson|first=Mark|title=GOP Bill Could Mean 'No More National Parks,' Public Land Advocates Warn|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/gop-bill-could-mean-no-more-national-parks-public-land-advocates-warn-1563152|accessdate=24 March 2014|newspaper=International Business Times|date=24 March 2014}}</ref> 

In addition to limiting the number of national monument declarations the president could make, the bill would forbid the government from declaring land belonging to a private owner as a national monument without the private owner's consent.<ref name="1459sum"/> Bishop argued that "the American people deserve the opportunity to participate in land-use decisions regardless of whether they are made in Congress or by the President". He claims his new bill would ensure "that new national monuments are created openly with consideration of public input".<ref name="IBTjohanson"/>
