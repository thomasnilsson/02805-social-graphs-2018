'''Christopher "Chris" Van Hollen, Jr.''' (born January 10, 1959) is the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|MD|8|}}, serving since 2003. He is a member of the [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]]. The district includes most of [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery County]], an affluent suburban county adjacent to [[Washington, D.C.]], as well as portions of [[Carroll County, Maryland|Carroll]] and [[Frederick County, Maryland|Frederick]] counties. He is an alumnus of the [[Kodaikanal International School]], a very prestigious school in southern India.

Speaker [[Nancy Pelosi]] created a new leadership post, Assistant to the Speaker, in 2006 so that Van Hollen could be present at all leadership meetings. After the Democrats regained control of the House in the [[U.S. House election, 2006|2006 elections]], Van Hollen became the chairman of the [[Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee]], the fifth-ranking position among House Democrats. In this post, Van Hollen was responsible for leading efforts to get more Democrats elected to Congress.

After the Democratic losses in 2010, Van Hollen did not run for re-election to chair of the DCCC. Van Hollen instead chose to run for the top Democratic spot on the [[House Budget Committee]], which was being vacated by outgoing chairman [[John Spratt]] who had been defeated for re-election. Van Hollen was elected as the ranking member on the Budget Committee on November 17, 2010.  Pelosi appointed him to the 12-member bipartisan [[United States Congress Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction|Committee on Deficit Reduction]] with a mandate for finding major budget reductions by late 2011. On October 17, 2013 Pelosi appointed Van Hollen to serve on the bicameral conference committee.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pelosi Names Conferees to FY 2014 Budget Conference|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140704022207/http://www.democraticleader.gov/Pelosi_Statement_on_Conferess_to_FY_2014_Budget_Conference|website=www.democraticleader.gov|accessdate=4 July 2014}}</ref>

Maryland's 8th District hugs the northern border of Washington, D.C. and is one of the wealthiest and most educated congressional districts in the nation. The federal government is the single largest employer in the district, and many private companies are funded by the government.<ref name="apsanet.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.apsanet.org/imgtest/PSJul03Abbe.pdf |title=American Political Science Association election review |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-08-31}}</ref>

In 2003, Van Hollen was named Outstanding New Member of the Year by the Committee for Education Funding, the nation's largest and oldest non-partisan education coalition.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bosland |first=Julie |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-111024488.html |title=CEF Honors members of Congress for education funding |publisher=Highbeam.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-31}}</ref> The first bill Van Hollen introduces every session is the Keep Our Promise to America's Children and Teachers (PACT) Act, which would fully fund [[No Child Left Behind]] and IDEA. He also introduced an amendment, which passed, that repealed a 9.5 percent loophole in [[student loan]]s that had allowed lenders to pocket billions of taxpayer dollars. Now, that money is available for additional student loans.<ref>[http://www.hillnews.com/thehill/export/TheHill/News/Campaign/071205.html House races loom large in student-loan debate]. ''The Hill'' {{dead link|date=August 2012}}</ref>

Because many federal employees live in his district, Van Hollen has worked on a number of issues relating to them. He supported pay parity in pay raises for civilian employees and introduced an amendment, which passed, to block attempts to [[outsourcing|outsource]] federal jobs.<ref>{{cite web|last=Mosquera |first=Mary |url=http://www.gcn.com/online/vol1_no1/23456-1.html |title=House votes against revised A-76 rules |publisher=GCN |date=September 10, 2003 |accessdate=2012-08-31}}</ref>

Van Hollen has secured federal funding for a number of local-interest projects, including transportation initiatives, local [[homeland security]] efforts, education programs and community development projects. Van Hollen has been a strong supporter of Palestinian Statehood throughout his career in Congress.

Van Hollen often joins his colleague, [[Adam Schiff]] (CA-29), to discuss issues of National Security on the floor of the House, with particular commentary on the wars in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.house.gov/apps/list/speech/md08_vanhollen/Real_Security_9_19.html |title=Transcript of Congress speech on national security |publisher=House.gov |date=September 19, 2006 |accessdate=2012-08-31}}</ref>

In May 2006, Van Hollen formed a Congressional Caucus on the [[Netherlands]] with Dutch-born Republican representative [[Pete Hoekstra]]. The goal of the caucus is to promote the U.S. relationship with the [[Netherlands]] and remember the Dutch role in establishing [[New York]] and the [[United States]].

In July 2006, Van Hollen urged the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]] to support a ceasefire supported by a peacekeeping force that would end the [[Israeli-Lebanon War]]. He was heavily criticized by the [[Jewish]] and pro-[[Israel]] community, a large part of his constituency. According to the ''[[Washington Jewish Week]]'', Van Hollen clarified but did not retract his position.<ref>[http://www.washingtonjewishweek.com/main.asp?SectionID=4&SubSectionID=4&ArticleID=5771&TM=88.381 ''Washington Jewish Week'': Critics emerge of Maryland Congressman] Also, see Ha'aretz article on AIPAC calling Van Hollen to recant: [http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/rosnerBlog.jhtml?itemNo=756837&contrassID=25&subContrassID=0&sbSubContrassID=1&listSrc=Y&art=1 haaretz.com: Get ready for the Democrats haaretz.com]</ref>

In 2006, Van Hollen opted out of the race to succeed the retiring Senator [[Paul Sarbanes]], saying he would rather spend time with his family and help elect more Democrats to Congress.<ref>{{cite web|last=Craig |first=Tim |last2=Wagner |first2=John |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/11/AR2005071101496.html |title=Van Hollen says he won't run for Senate |publisher=The Washington Post |date=July 12, 2005 |accessdate=2012-08-31}}</ref> In keeping with that, Van Hollen was appointed to Chairman of the [[Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee]].

In 2009, Van Hollen introduced a bill which establishes a [[Clean Energy Bank|Green Bank]] to catalyze the financing of [[clean energy]] and [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] projects.<ref>[http://www.newenergyworldnetwork.com/renewable-energy-news/by_technology/energy_efficiency/the-coalition-for-green-bank-applauds-congressman-chris-van-hollens-green-bank-act.html Coalition for Green Bank applauds US Congressman Chris Van Hollen’s Green Bank Act.] ''New Net.''

In March 2010, when [[Charles Rangel]] was forced to resign as Chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means over ethics charges, Van Hollen played a key role in having [[Sander Levin]] succeed to the Chairmanship over [[Pete Stark]]. Stark was the second-most experienced member of the committee while Levin was third, and party tradition would have made Stark chairman due to seniority. However, Van Hollen and other younger members saw Stark's past intemperate comments as a liability to the Democrats in an election year.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/03/04/AR2010030402174.html?hpid=topnews | work=The Washington Post | first=Paul | last=Kane | title=Michigan's Sander Levin replaces Rangel as House Ways and Means chairman | date=March 5, 2010}}</ref>

On April 29, 2010, Van Hollen introduced the campaign finance [[DISCLOSE Act]].<ref>[http://www.thomas.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:h.r.05175: H.R. 5175] [[THOMAS]]</ref> He reintroduced the bill for the 113th Congress on February 9, 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=Van Hollen, House Democrats Introduce DISCLOSE 2012 Act|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140704025410/http://vanhollen.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/van-hollen-house-democrats-introduce-disclose-2012-act|website=vanhollen.house.gov|accessdate=4 July 2014}}</ref>

In April 2011, Van Hollen sued the [[Federal Election Commission]], charging it with [[regulatory capture]] and the creation of a loop hole that allowed unlimited and undisclosed financing in the 2010 election reason.  Had it not been for the loophole, according to  Hollen "much of the more than $135 million in secret contributions that funded expenditures would have been disclosed." <ref>{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/fundraising/157195-top-democrat-sues-federal-election-commission-over-anonymous-donors |title=Top Democrat sues Federal Election Commission over anonymous donors |publisher=The Hill |date=April 21, 2011 |accessdate=2012-08-31}}</ref>

Congressman Van Hollen has been a strong supporter of disability rights, especially for individuals with intellectual disabilities. In 2010 he became a co-chair of the Congressional Down Syndrome Caucus and has sponsored numerous bills that would benefit individuals with disabilities.

==Political campaigns==
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Maryland, 2010#8th Congressional District}}
Prior to Van Hollen's election, incumbent [[Connie Morella]] had won eight elections in the district, despite the fact that she was a Republican in a district where Democrats far outnumbered Republicans. Morella's success was largely attributed to her political independence and relatively [[Liberalism|liberal]] voting record, including support for [[abortion rights]], [[gay rights]], [[gun control]] and increased [[environmentalism|environmental protections]].

After Morella's re-election in 2000, Democratic [[Maryland Senate]] President [[Thomas V. Miller, Jr.|Thomas V. "Mike" Miller]] made no secret that he wanted to draw the 8th out from under Morella. Indeed, one [[redistricting]] plan after the 2000 Census went so far as to divide the 8th in two, giving one district to Van Hollen and forcing Morella to run against popular State Delegate [[Mark Kennedy Shriver]] in November. The final plan was far less ambitious, but made the district even more Democratic by adding heavily Democratic precincts from neighboring [[Prince George's County]], an area that Morella had never represented. It also restored a heavily Democratic spur in eastern Montgomery County that had been cut out in the last round of redistricting.

In 2002, Van Hollen entered a competitive Democratic Party primary against Shriver and former [[Clinton administration]] aide [[Ira Shapiro]]. Though Shriver had the most money, Van Hollen launched a very successful grassroots effort that mobilized Democratic voters. After receiving the endorsement of the ''[[Washington Post]]'', the ''[[Baltimore Sun]]'', and other local papers, Van Hollen defeated Shriver 43.5 percent to 40.6 percent.

During the campaign, Van Hollen emphasized that even when Morella voted with the district, her partisan affiliation kept [[Tom DeLay]] and the rest of her party's more conservative leadership in power. Van Hollen also touted his leadership in the State Senate on issues such as education funding, [[HMO]] reform, [[trigger lock]]s for handguns, and protecting the [[Chesapeake Bay]] from [[oil drilling]]. Ultimately, after a tight race, Van Hollen defeated Morella 51.7 percent to 48.2 percent.<ref name="apsanet.org"/>  Van Hollen crushed Morella in the Prince George's County portion of the district, while narrowly winning Montgomery County.  However, Morella won the precincts she'd previously represented.

Proving just how Democratic this district was, Van Hollen was reelected four times from this district by over 70 percent of the vote.  However, it had long been taken for granted that the Republicans would face extremely long odds of retaking the seat if Morella retired or was defeated in an election.

After the 2010 census, Van Hollen's district was made slightly less Democratic.  He lost a heavily Democratic spur of Montgomery County to the neighboring [[Maryland's 6th congressional district|6th district]], and lost his share of Prince George's County to the [[Maryland's 4th congressional district|4th district]].  In their place, the 8th absorbed heavily  and a strongly Republican spur of Frederick County.  Nonetheless, since his share of Montgomery County has more than double the population of his shares of Carroll and Frederick counties combined, Van Hollen easily won a sixth term over  with 63 percent of the vote.  While Van Hollen lost in Carroll and Frederick, he swamped Timmerman in Montgomery by 113,500 votes.

==Role in the U.S. government shutdown of 2013==
{{main|United States federal government shutdown of 2013}}
According to the [[Huffington Post]], after the [[United States federal government shutdown of 2013|federal government shutdown]] began Van Hollen attempted to reopen the government by bringing a vote to raise the debt ceiling before the entire House. However, he was prevented from doing so by a recent change in rules:
" (R-Utah), presiding over the chamber, told Van Hollen that the rule he was asking to use had been “altered” and he did not have the privilege of bringing that vote to the floor. In the ensuing back and forth, Chaffetz said the recently passed House Resolution 368 trumped the standing rules. Where any member of the House previously could have brought the clean resolution to the floor under House Rule 22, House Resolution 368 — passed on the eve of the shutdown — gave that right exclusively to the House majority leader,  of Virginia.

“The Rules Committee, under the rules of the House, changed the standing rules of the House to take away the right of any member to move to vote to open the government, and gave that right exclusively to the Republican Leader,” said Van Hollen. “Is that right?”

“The House adopted that resolution,” replied Chaffetz.

“I make my motion, Mr. Speaker,” said Van Hollen. “I renew my motion that under the regular standing rules of the House… that the house take up the Senate amendments and open the government now.”

“Under section 2 of H.R. 368, that motion may be offered only by the majority leader or his designee,” Chaffetz said.

“Mr. Speaker, why were the rules rigged to keep the government shut down?” Van Hollen asked.

“The gentleman will suspend,” Chaffetz interjected.

“Democracy has been suspended, Mr. Speaker.”" {(Retrieved from the Huffington Post.)

'''Christopher "Chris" Van Hollen, Jr.''' (born January 10, 1959) is the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|MD|8|}}, serving since 2003. He is a member of the [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]]. The district includes most of [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery County]], an affluent suburban county adjacent to [[Washington, D.C.]], as well as portions of [[Carroll County, Maryland|Carroll]] and [[Frederick County, Maryland|Frederick]] counties. He is an alumnus of the [[Kodaikanal International School]], a very prestigious school in southern India.

Speaker [[Nancy Pelosi]] created a new leadership post, Assistant to the Speaker, in 2006 so that Van Hollen could be present at all leadership meetings. After the Democrats regained control of the House in the [[U.S. House election, 2006|2006 elections]], Van Hollen became the chairman of the [[Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee]], the fifth-ranking position among House Democrats. In this post, Van Hollen was responsible for leading efforts to get more Democrats elected to Congress.

After the Democratic losses in 2010, Van Hollen did not run for re-election to chair of the DCCC. Van Hollen instead chose to run for the top Democratic spot on the [[House Budget Committee]], which was being vacated by outgoing chairman [[John Spratt]] who had been defeated for re-election. Van Hollen was elected as the ranking member on the Budget Committee on November 17, 2010.  Pelosi appointed him to the 12-member bipartisan [[United States Congress Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction|Committee on Deficit Reduction]] with a mandate for finding major budget reductions by late 2011. On October 17, 2013 Pelosi appointed Van Hollen to serve on the bicameral conference committee.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pelosi Names Conferees to FY 2014 Budget Conference|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140704022207/http://www.democraticleader.gov/Pelosi_Statement_on_Conferess_to_FY_2014_Budget_Conference|website=www.democraticleader.gov|accessdate=4 July 2014}}</ref>

Maryland's 8th District hugs the northern border of Washington, D.C. and is one of the wealthiest and most educated congressional districts in the nation. The federal government is the single largest employer in the district, and many private companies are funded by the government.<ref name="apsanet.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.apsanet.org/imgtest/PSJul03Abbe.pdf |title=American Political Science Association election review |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-08-31}}</ref>

In 2003, Van Hollen was named Outstanding New Member of the Year by the Committee for Education Funding, the nation's largest and oldest non-partisan education coalition.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bosland |first=Julie |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-111024488.html |title=CEF Honors members of Congress for education funding |publisher=Highbeam.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-31}}</ref> The first bill Van Hollen introduces every session is the Keep Our Promise to America's Children and Teachers (PACT) Act, which would fully fund [[No Child Left Behind]] and IDEA. He also introduced an amendment, which passed, that repealed a 9.5 percent loophole in [[student loan]]s that had allowed lenders to pocket billions of taxpayer dollars. Now, that money is available for additional student loans.<ref>[http://www.hillnews.com/thehill/export/TheHill/News/Campaign/071205.html House races loom large in student-loan debate]. ''The Hill'' {{dead link|date=August 2012}}</ref>

Because many federal employees live in his district, Van Hollen has worked on a number of issues relating to them. He supported pay parity in pay raises for civilian employees and introduced an amendment, which passed, to block attempts to [[outsourcing|outsource]] federal jobs.<ref>{{cite web|last=Mosquera |first=Mary |url=http://www.gcn.com/online/vol1_no1/23456-1.html |title=House votes against revised A-76 rules |publisher=GCN |date=September 10, 2003 |accessdate=2012-08-31}}</ref>

Van Hollen has secured federal funding for a number of local-interest projects, including transportation initiatives, local [[homeland security]] efforts, education programs and community development projects. Van Hollen has been a strong supporter of Palestinian Statehood throughout his career in Congress.

Van Hollen often joins his colleague, [[Adam Schiff]] (CA-29), to discuss issues of National Security on the floor of the House, with particular commentary on the wars in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.house.gov/apps/list/speech/md08_vanhollen/Real_Security_9_19.html |title=Transcript of Congress speech on national security |publisher=House.gov |date=September 19, 2006 |accessdate=2012-08-31}}</ref>

In May 2006, Van Hollen formed a Congressional Caucus on the [[Netherlands]] with Dutch-born Republican representative [[Pete Hoekstra]]. The goal of the caucus is to promote the U.S. relationship with the [[Netherlands]] and remember the Dutch role in establishing [[New York]] and the [[United States]].

In July 2006, Van Hollen urged the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]] to support a ceasefire supported by a peacekeeping force that would end the [[Israeli-Lebanon War]]. He was heavily criticized by the [[Jewish]] and pro-[[Israel]] community, a large part of his constituency. According to the ''[[Washington Jewish Week]]'', Van Hollen clarified but did not retract his position.<ref>[http://www.washingtonjewishweek.com/main.asp?SectionID=4&SubSectionID=4&ArticleID=5771&TM=88.381 ''Washington Jewish Week'': Critics emerge of Maryland Congressman] Also, see Ha'aretz article on AIPAC calling Van Hollen to recant: [http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/rosnerBlog.jhtml?itemNo=756837&contrassID=25&subContrassID=0&sbSubContrassID=1&listSrc=Y&art=1 haaretz.com: Get ready for the Democrats haaretz.com]</ref>

In 2006, Van Hollen opted out of the race to succeed the retiring Senator [[Paul Sarbanes]], saying he would rather spend time with his family and help elect more Democrats to Congress.<ref>{{cite web|last=Craig |first=Tim |last2=Wagner |first2=John |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/11/AR2005071101496.html |title=Van Hollen says he won't run for Senate |publisher=The Washington Post |date=July 12, 2005 |accessdate=2012-08-31}}</ref> In keeping with that, Van Hollen was appointed to Chairman of the [[Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee]].

In 2009, Van Hollen introduced a bill which establishes a [[Clean Energy Bank|Green Bank]] to catalyze the financing of [[clean energy]] and [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] projects.<ref>[http://www.newenergyworldnetwork.com/renewable-energy-news/by_technology/energy_efficiency/the-coalition-for-green-bank-applauds-congressman-chris-van-hollens-green-bank-act.html Coalition for Green Bank applauds US Congressman Chris Van Hollen’s Green Bank Act.] ''New Net.''

In March 2010, when [[Charles Rangel]] was forced to resign as Chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means over ethics charges, Van Hollen played a key role in having [[Sander Levin]] succeed to the Chairmanship over [[Pete Stark]]. Stark was the second-most experienced member of the committee while Levin was third, and party tradition would have made Stark chairman due to seniority. However, Van Hollen and other younger members saw Stark's past intemperate comments as a liability to the Democrats in an election year.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/03/04/AR2010030402174.html?hpid=topnews | work=The Washington Post | first=Paul | last=Kane | title=Michigan's Sander Levin replaces Rangel as House Ways and Means chairman | date=March 5, 2010}}</ref>

On April 29, 2010, Van Hollen introduced the campaign finance [[DISCLOSE Act]].<ref>[http://www.thomas.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:h.r.05175: H.R. 5175] [[THOMAS]]</ref> He reintroduced the bill for the 113th Congress on February 9, 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=Van Hollen, House Democrats Introduce DISCLOSE 2012 Act|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140704025410/http://vanhollen.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/van-hollen-house-democrats-introduce-disclose-2012-act|website=vanhollen.house.gov|accessdate=4 July 2014}}</ref>

In April 2011, Van Hollen sued the [[Federal Election Commission]], charging it with [[regulatory capture]] and the creation of a loop hole that allowed unlimited and undisclosed financing in the 2010 election reason.  Had it not been for the loophole, according to  Hollen "much of the more than $135 million in secret contributions that funded expenditures would have been disclosed." <ref>{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/fundraising/157195-top-democrat-sues-federal-election-commission-over-anonymous-donors |title=Top Democrat sues Federal Election Commission over anonymous donors |publisher=The Hill |date=April 21, 2011 |accessdate=2012-08-31}}</ref>

Congressman Van Hollen has been a strong supporter of disability rights, especially for individuals with intellectual disabilities. In 2010 he became a co-chair of the Congressional Down Syndrome Caucus and has sponsored numerous bills that would benefit individuals with disabilities.

==Political campaigns==
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Maryland, 2010#8th Congressional District}}
Prior to Van Hollen's election, incumbent [[Connie Morella]] had won eight elections in the district, despite the fact that she was a Republican in a district where Democrats far outnumbered Republicans. Morella's success was largely attributed to her political independence and relatively [[Liberalism|liberal]] voting record, including support for [[abortion rights]], [[gay rights]], [[gun control]] and increased [[environmentalism|environmental protections]].

After Morella's re-election in 2000, Democratic [[Maryland Senate]] President [[Thomas V. Miller, Jr.|Thomas V. "Mike" Miller]] made no secret that he wanted to draw the 8th out from under Morella. Indeed, one [[redistricting]] plan after the 2000 Census went so far as to divide the 8th in two, giving one district to Van Hollen and forcing Morella to run against popular State Delegate [[Mark Kennedy Shriver]] in November. The final plan was far less ambitious, but made the district even more Democratic by adding heavily Democratic precincts from neighboring [[Prince George's County]], an area that Morella had never represented. It also restored a heavily Democratic spur in eastern Montgomery County that had been cut out in the last round of redistricting.

In 2002, Van Hollen entered a competitive Democratic Party primary against Shriver and former [[Clinton administration]] aide [[Ira Shapiro]]. Though Shriver had the most money, Van Hollen launched a very successful grassroots effort that mobilized Democratic voters. After receiving the endorsement of the ''[[Washington Post]]'', the ''[[Baltimore Sun]]'', and other local papers, Van Hollen defeated Shriver 43.5 percent to 40.6 percent.

During the campaign, Van Hollen emphasized that even when Morella voted with the district, her partisan affiliation kept [[Tom DeLay]] and the rest of her party's more conservative leadership in power. Van Hollen also touted his leadership in the State Senate on issues such as education funding, [[HMO]] reform, [[trigger lock]]s for handguns, and protecting the [[Chesapeake Bay]] from [[oil drilling]]. Ultimately, after a tight race, Van Hollen defeated Morella 51.7 percent to 48.2 percent.<ref name="apsanet.org"/>  Van Hollen crushed Morella in the Prince George's County portion of the district, while narrowly winning Montgomery County.  However, Morella won the precincts she'd previously represented.

Proving just how Democratic this district was, Van Hollen was reelected four times from this district by over 70 percent of the vote.  However, it had long been taken for granted that the Republicans would face extremely long odds of retaking the seat if Morella retired or was defeated in an election.

After the 2010 census, Van Hollen's district was made slightly less Democratic.  He lost a heavily Democratic spur of Montgomery County to the neighboring [[Maryland's 6th congressional district|6th district]], and lost his share of Prince George's County to the [[Maryland's 4th congressional district|4th district]].  In their place, the 8th absorbed heavily  and a strongly Republican spur of Frederick County.  Nonetheless, since his share of Montgomery County has more than double the population of his shares of Carroll and Frederick counties combined, Van Hollen easily won a sixth term over  with 63 percent of the vote.  While Van Hollen lost in Carroll and Frederick, he swamped Timmerman in Montgomery by 113,500 votes.

==Role in the U.S. government shutdown of 2013==
{{main|United States federal government shutdown of 2013}}
According to the [[Huffington Post]], after the [[United States federal government shutdown of 2013|federal government shutdown]] began Van Hollen attempted to reopen the government by bringing a vote to raise the debt ceiling before the entire House. However, he was prevented from doing so by a recent change in rules:
" (R-Utah), presiding over the chamber, told Van Hollen that the rule he was asking to use had been “altered” and he did not have the privilege of bringing that vote to the floor. In the ensuing back and forth, Chaffetz said the recently passed House Resolution 368 trumped the standing rules. Where any member of the House previously could have brought the clean resolution to the floor under House Rule 22, House Resolution 368 — passed on the eve of the shutdown — gave that right exclusively to the House majority leader,  of Virginia.

“The Rules Committee, under the rules of the House, changed the standing rules of the House to take away the right of any member to move to vote to open the government, and gave that right exclusively to the Republican Leader,” said Van Hollen. “Is that right?”

“The House adopted that resolution,” replied Chaffetz.

“I make my motion, Mr. Speaker,” said Van Hollen. “I renew my motion that under the regular standing rules of the House… that the house take up the Senate amendments and open the government now.”

“Under section 2 of H.R. 368, that motion may be offered only by the majority leader or his designee,” Chaffetz said.

“Mr. Speaker, why were the rules rigged to keep the government shut down?” Van Hollen asked.

“The gentleman will suspend,” Chaffetz interjected.

“Democracy has been suspended, Mr. Speaker.”" {(Retrieved from the Huffington Post.)

'''Christopher "Chris" Van Hollen, Jr.''' (born January 10, 1959) is the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|MD|8|}}, serving since 2003. He is a member of the [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]]. The district includes most of [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery County]], an affluent suburban county adjacent to [[Washington, D.C.]], as well as portions of [[Carroll County, Maryland|Carroll]] and [[Frederick County, Maryland|Frederick]] counties. He is an alumnus of the [[Kodaikanal International School]], a very prestigious school in southern India.

Speaker [[Nancy Pelosi]] created a new leadership post, Assistant to the Speaker, in 2006 so that Van Hollen could be present at all leadership meetings. After the Democrats regained control of the House in the [[U.S. House election, 2006|2006 elections]], Van Hollen became the chairman of the [[Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee]], the fifth-ranking position among House Democrats. In this post, Van Hollen was responsible for leading efforts to get more Democrats elected to Congress.

After the Democratic losses in 2010, Van Hollen did not run for re-election to chair of the DCCC. Van Hollen instead chose to run for the top Democratic spot on the [[House Budget Committee]], which was being vacated by outgoing chairman [[John Spratt]] who had been defeated for re-election. Van Hollen was elected as the ranking member on the Budget Committee on November 17, 2010.  Pelosi appointed him to the 12-member bipartisan [[United States Congress Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction|Committee on Deficit Reduction]] with a mandate for finding major budget reductions by late 2011. On October 17, 2013 Pelosi appointed Van Hollen to serve on the bicameral conference committee.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pelosi Names Conferees to FY 2014 Budget Conference|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140704022207/http://www.democraticleader.gov/Pelosi_Statement_on_Conferess_to_FY_2014_Budget_Conference|website=www.democraticleader.gov|accessdate=4 July 2014}}</ref>

Maryland's 8th District hugs the northern border of Washington, D.C. and is one of the wealthiest and most educated congressional districts in the nation. The federal government is the single largest employer in the district, and many private companies are funded by the government.<ref name="apsanet.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.apsanet.org/imgtest/PSJul03Abbe.pdf |title=American Political Science Association election review |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-08-31}}</ref>

In 2003, Van Hollen was named Outstanding New Member of the Year by the Committee for Education Funding, the nation's largest and oldest non-partisan education coalition.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bosland |first=Julie |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-111024488.html |title=CEF Honors members of Congress for education funding |publisher=Highbeam.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-31}}</ref> The first bill Van Hollen introduces every session is the Keep Our Promise to America's Children and Teachers (PACT) Act, which would fully fund [[No Child Left Behind]] and IDEA. He also introduced an amendment, which passed, that repealed a 9.5 percent loophole in [[student loan]]s that had allowed lenders to pocket billions of taxpayer dollars. Now, that money is available for additional student loans.<ref>[http://www.hillnews.com/thehill/export/TheHill/News/Campaign/071205.html House races loom large in student-loan debate]. ''The Hill'' {{dead link|date=August 2012}}</ref>

Because many federal employees live in his district, Van Hollen has worked on a number of issues relating to them. He supported pay parity in pay raises for civilian employees and introduced an amendment, which passed, to block attempts to [[outsourcing|outsource]] federal jobs.<ref>{{cite web|last=Mosquera |first=Mary |url=http://www.gcn.com/online/vol1_no1/23456-1.html |title=House votes against revised A-76 rules |publisher=GCN |date=September 10, 2003 |accessdate=2012-08-31}}</ref>

Van Hollen has secured federal funding for a number of local-interest projects, including transportation initiatives, local [[homeland security]] efforts, education programs and community development projects. Van Hollen has been a strong supporter of Palestinian Statehood throughout his career in Congress.

Van Hollen often joins his colleague, [[Adam Schiff]] (CA-29), to discuss issues of National Security on the floor of the House, with particular commentary on the wars in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.house.gov/apps/list/speech/md08_vanhollen/Real_Security_9_19.html |title=Transcript of Congress speech on national security |publisher=House.gov |date=September 19, 2006 |accessdate=2012-08-31}}</ref>

In May 2006, Van Hollen formed a Congressional Caucus on the [[Netherlands]] with Dutch-born Republican representative [[Pete Hoekstra]]. The goal of the caucus is to promote the U.S. relationship with the [[Netherlands]] and remember the Dutch role in establishing [[New York]] and the [[United States]].

In July 2006, Van Hollen urged the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]] to support a ceasefire supported by a peacekeeping force that would end the [[Israeli-Lebanon War]]. He was heavily criticized by the [[Jewish]] and pro-[[Israel]] community, a large part of his constituency. According to the ''[[Washington Jewish Week]]'', Van Hollen clarified but did not retract his position.<ref>[http://www.washingtonjewishweek.com/main.asp?SectionID=4&SubSectionID=4&ArticleID=5771&TM=88.381 ''Washington Jewish Week'': Critics emerge of Maryland Congressman] Also, see Ha'aretz article on AIPAC calling Van Hollen to recant: [http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/rosnerBlog.jhtml?itemNo=756837&contrassID=25&subContrassID=0&sbSubContrassID=1&listSrc=Y&art=1 haaretz.com: Get ready for the Democrats haaretz.com]</ref>

In 2006, Van Hollen opted out of the race to succeed the retiring Senator [[Paul Sarbanes]], saying he would rather spend time with his family and help elect more Democrats to Congress.<ref>{{cite web|last=Craig |first=Tim |last2=Wagner |first2=John |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/11/AR2005071101496.html |title=Van Hollen says he won't run for Senate |publisher=The Washington Post |date=July 12, 2005 |accessdate=2012-08-31}}</ref> In keeping with that, Van Hollen was appointed to Chairman of the [[Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee]].

In 2009, Van Hollen introduced a bill which establishes a [[Clean Energy Bank|Green Bank]] to catalyze the financing of [[clean energy]] and [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] projects.<ref>[http://www.newenergyworldnetwork.com/renewable-energy-news/by_technology/energy_efficiency/the-coalition-for-green-bank-applauds-congressman-chris-van-hollens-green-bank-act.html Coalition for Green Bank applauds US Congressman Chris Van Hollen’s Green Bank Act.] ''New Net.''

In March 2010, when [[Charles Rangel]] was forced to resign as Chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means over ethics charges, Van Hollen played a key role in having [[Sander Levin]] succeed to the Chairmanship over [[Pete Stark]]. Stark was the second-most experienced member of the committee while Levin was third, and party tradition would have made Stark chairman due to seniority. However, Van Hollen and other younger members saw Stark's past intemperate comments as a liability to the Democrats in an election year.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/03/04/AR2010030402174.html?hpid=topnews | work=The Washington Post | first=Paul | last=Kane | title=Michigan's Sander Levin replaces Rangel as House Ways and Means chairman | date=March 5, 2010}}</ref>

On April 29, 2010, Van Hollen introduced the campaign finance [[DISCLOSE Act]].<ref>[http://www.thomas.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:h.r.05175: H.R. 5175] [[THOMAS]]</ref> He reintroduced the bill for the 113th Congress on February 9, 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=Van Hollen, House Democrats Introduce DISCLOSE 2012 Act|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140704025410/http://vanhollen.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/van-hollen-house-democrats-introduce-disclose-2012-act|website=vanhollen.house.gov|accessdate=4 July 2014}}</ref>

In April 2011, Van Hollen sued the [[Federal Election Commission]], charging it with [[regulatory capture]] and the creation of a loop hole that allowed unlimited and undisclosed financing in the 2010 election reason.  Had it not been for the loophole, according to  Hollen "much of the more than $135 million in secret contributions that funded expenditures would have been disclosed." <ref>{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/fundraising/157195-top-democrat-sues-federal-election-commission-over-anonymous-donors |title=Top Democrat sues Federal Election Commission over anonymous donors |publisher=The Hill |date=April 21, 2011 |accessdate=2012-08-31}}</ref>

Congressman Van Hollen has been a strong supporter of disability rights, especially for individuals with intellectual disabilities. In 2010 he became a co-chair of the Congressional Down Syndrome Caucus and has sponsored numerous bills that would benefit individuals with disabilities.

==Political campaigns==
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Maryland, 2010#8th Congressional District}}
Prior to Van Hollen's election, incumbent [[Connie Morella]] had won eight elections in the district, despite the fact that she was a Republican in a district where Democrats far outnumbered Republicans. Morella's success was largely attributed to her political independence and relatively [[Liberalism|liberal]] voting record, including support for [[abortion rights]], [[gay rights]], [[gun control]] and increased [[environmentalism|environmental protections]].

After Morella's re-election in 2000, Democratic [[Maryland Senate]] President [[Thomas V. Miller, Jr.|Thomas V. "Mike" Miller]] made no secret that he wanted to draw the 8th out from under Morella. Indeed, one [[redistricting]] plan after the 2000 Census went so far as to divide the 8th in two, giving one district to Van Hollen and forcing Morella to run against popular State Delegate [[Mark Kennedy Shriver]] in November. The final plan was far less ambitious, but made the district even more Democratic by adding heavily Democratic precincts from neighboring [[Prince George's County]], an area that Morella had never represented. It also restored a heavily Democratic spur in eastern Montgomery County that had been cut out in the last round of redistricting.

In 2002, Van Hollen entered a competitive Democratic Party primary against Shriver and former [[Clinton administration]] aide [[Ira Shapiro]]. Though Shriver had the most money, Van Hollen launched a very successful grassroots effort that mobilized Democratic voters. After receiving the endorsement of the ''[[Washington Post]]'', the ''[[Baltimore Sun]]'', and other local papers, Van Hollen defeated Shriver 43.5 percent to 40.6 percent.

During the campaign, Van Hollen emphasized that even when Morella voted with the district, her partisan affiliation kept [[Tom DeLay]] and the rest of her party's more conservative leadership in power. Van Hollen also touted his leadership in the State Senate on issues such as education funding, [[HMO]] reform, [[trigger lock]]s for handguns, and protecting the [[Chesapeake Bay]] from [[oil drilling]]. Ultimately, after a tight race, Van Hollen defeated Morella 51.7 percent to 48.2 percent.<ref name="apsanet.org"/>  Van Hollen crushed Morella in the Prince George's County portion of the district, while narrowly winning Montgomery County.  However, Morella won the precincts she'd previously represented.

Proving just how Democratic this district was, Van Hollen was reelected four times from this district by over 70 percent of the vote.  However, it had long been taken for granted that the Republicans would face extremely long odds of retaking the seat if Morella retired or was defeated in an election.

After the 2010 census, Van Hollen's district was made slightly less Democratic.  He lost a heavily Democratic spur of Montgomery County to the neighboring [[Maryland's 6th congressional district|6th district]], and lost his share of Prince George's County to the [[Maryland's 4th congressional district|4th district]].  In their place, the 8th absorbed heavily  and a strongly Republican spur of Frederick County.  Nonetheless, since his share of Montgomery County has more than double the population of his shares of Carroll and Frederick counties combined, Van Hollen easily won a sixth term over  with 63 percent of the vote.  While Van Hollen lost in Carroll and Frederick, he swamped Timmerman in Montgomery by 113,500 votes.

==Role in the U.S. government shutdown of 2013==
{{main|United States federal government shutdown of 2013}}
According to the [[Huffington Post]], after the [[United States federal government shutdown of 2013|federal government shutdown]] began Van Hollen attempted to reopen the government by bringing a vote to raise the debt ceiling before the entire House. However, he was prevented from doing so by a recent change in rules:
" (R-Utah), presiding over the chamber, told Van Hollen that the rule he was asking to use had been “altered” and he did not have the privilege of bringing that vote to the floor. In the ensuing back and forth, Chaffetz said the recently passed House Resolution 368 trumped the standing rules. Where any member of the House previously could have brought the clean resolution to the floor under House Rule 22, House Resolution 368 — passed on the eve of the shutdown — gave that right exclusively to the House majority leader,  of Virginia.

“The Rules Committee, under the rules of the House, changed the standing rules of the House to take away the right of any member to move to vote to open the government, and gave that right exclusively to the Republican Leader,” said Van Hollen. “Is that right?”

“The House adopted that resolution,” replied Chaffetz.

“I make my motion, Mr. Speaker,” said Van Hollen. “I renew my motion that under the regular standing rules of the House… that the house take up the Senate amendments and open the government now.”

“Under section 2 of H.R. 368, that motion may be offered only by the majority leader or his designee,” Chaffetz said.

“Mr. Speaker, why were the rules rigged to keep the government shut down?” Van Hollen asked.

“The gentleman will suspend,” Chaffetz interjected.

“Democracy has been suspended, Mr. Speaker.”" {(Retrieved from the Huffington Post.)

'''Christopher "Chris" Van Hollen, Jr.''' (born January 10, 1959) is the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|MD|8|}}, serving since 2003. He is a member of the [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]]. The district includes most of [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery County]], an affluent suburban county adjacent to [[Washington, D.C.]], as well as portions of [[Carroll County, Maryland|Carroll]] and [[Frederick County, Maryland|Frederick]] counties. He is an alumnus of the [[Kodaikanal International School]], a very prestigious school in southern India.

Speaker [[Nancy Pelosi]] created a new leadership post, Assistant to the Speaker, in 2006 so that Van Hollen could be present at all leadership meetings. After the Democrats regained control of the House in the [[U.S. House election, 2006|2006 elections]], Van Hollen became the chairman of the [[Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee]], the fifth-ranking position among House Democrats. In this post, Van Hollen was responsible for leading efforts to get more Democrats elected to Congress.

After the Democratic losses in 2010, Van Hollen did not run for re-election to chair of the DCCC. Van Hollen instead chose to run for the top Democratic spot on the [[House Budget Committee]], which was being vacated by outgoing chairman [[John Spratt]] who had been defeated for re-election. Van Hollen was elected as the ranking member on the Budget Committee on November 17, 2010.  Pelosi appointed him to the 12-member bipartisan [[United States Congress Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction|Committee on Deficit Reduction]] with a mandate for finding major budget reductions by late 2011. On October 17, 2013 Pelosi appointed Van Hollen to serve on the bicameral conference committee.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pelosi Names Conferees to FY 2014 Budget Conference|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140704022207/http://www.democraticleader.gov/Pelosi_Statement_on_Conferess_to_FY_2014_Budget_Conference|website=www.democraticleader.gov|accessdate=4 July 2014}}</ref>

Maryland's 8th District hugs the northern border of Washington, D.C. and is one of the wealthiest and most educated congressional districts in the nation. The federal government is the single largest employer in the district, and many private companies are funded by the government.<ref name="apsanet.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.apsanet.org/imgtest/PSJul03Abbe.pdf |title=American Political Science Association election review |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-08-31}}</ref>

In 2003, Van Hollen was named Outstanding New Member of the Year by the Committee for Education Funding, the nation's largest and oldest non-partisan education coalition.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bosland |first=Julie |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-111024488.html |title=CEF Honors members of Congress for education funding |publisher=Highbeam.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-31}}</ref> The first bill Van Hollen introduces every session is the Keep Our Promise to America's Children and Teachers (PACT) Act, which would fully fund [[No Child Left Behind]] and IDEA. He also introduced an amendment, which passed, that repealed a 9.5 percent loophole in [[student loan]]s that had allowed lenders to pocket billions of taxpayer dollars. Now, that money is available for additional student loans.<ref>[http://www.hillnews.com/thehill/export/TheHill/News/Campaign/071205.html House races loom large in student-loan debate]. ''The Hill'' {{dead link|date=August 2012}}</ref>

Because many federal employees live in his district, Van Hollen has worked on a number of issues relating to them. He supported pay parity in pay raises for civilian employees and introduced an amendment, which passed, to block attempts to [[outsourcing|outsource]] federal jobs.<ref>{{cite web|last=Mosquera |first=Mary |url=http://www.gcn.com/online/vol1_no1/23456-1.html |title=House votes against revised A-76 rules |publisher=GCN |date=September 10, 2003 |accessdate=2012-08-31}}</ref>

Van Hollen has secured federal funding for a number of local-interest projects, including transportation initiatives, local [[homeland security]] efforts, education programs and community development projects. Van Hollen has been a strong supporter of Palestinian Statehood throughout his career in Congress.

Van Hollen often joins his colleague, [[Adam Schiff]] (CA-29), to discuss issues of National Security on the floor of the House, with particular commentary on the wars in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.house.gov/apps/list/speech/md08_vanhollen/Real_Security_9_19.html |title=Transcript of Congress speech on national security |publisher=House.gov |date=September 19, 2006 |accessdate=2012-08-31}}</ref>

In May 2006, Van Hollen formed a Congressional Caucus on the [[Netherlands]] with Dutch-born Republican representative [[Pete Hoekstra]]. The goal of the caucus is to promote the U.S. relationship with the [[Netherlands]] and remember the Dutch role in establishing [[New York]] and the [[United States]].

In July 2006, Van Hollen urged the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]] to support a ceasefire supported by a peacekeeping force that would end the [[Israeli-Lebanon War]]. He was heavily criticized by the [[Jewish]] and pro-[[Israel]] community, a large part of his constituency. According to the ''[[Washington Jewish Week]]'', Van Hollen clarified but did not retract his position.<ref>[http://www.washingtonjewishweek.com/main.asp?SectionID=4&SubSectionID=4&ArticleID=5771&TM=88.381 ''Washington Jewish Week'': Critics emerge of Maryland Congressman] Also, see Ha'aretz article on AIPAC calling Van Hollen to recant: [http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/rosnerBlog.jhtml?itemNo=756837&contrassID=25&subContrassID=0&sbSubContrassID=1&listSrc=Y&art=1 haaretz.com: Get ready for the Democrats haaretz.com]</ref>

In 2006, Van Hollen opted out of the race to succeed the retiring Senator [[Paul Sarbanes]], saying he would rather spend time with his family and help elect more Democrats to Congress.<ref>{{cite web|last=Craig |first=Tim |last2=Wagner |first2=John |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/11/AR2005071101496.html |title=Van Hollen says he won't run for Senate |publisher=The Washington Post |date=July 12, 2005 |accessdate=2012-08-31}}</ref> In keeping with that, Van Hollen was appointed to Chairman of the [[Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee]].

In 2009, Van Hollen introduced a bill which establishes a [[Clean Energy Bank|Green Bank]] to catalyze the financing of [[clean energy]] and [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] projects.<ref>[http://www.newenergyworldnetwork.com/renewable-energy-news/by_technology/energy_efficiency/the-coalition-for-green-bank-applauds-congressman-chris-van-hollens-green-bank-act.html Coalition for Green Bank applauds US Congressman Chris Van Hollen’s Green Bank Act.] ''New Net.''

In March 2010, when [[Charles Rangel]] was forced to resign as Chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means over ethics charges, Van Hollen played a key role in having [[Sander Levin]] succeed to the Chairmanship over [[Pete Stark]]. Stark was the second-most experienced member of the committee while Levin was third, and party tradition would have made Stark chairman due to seniority. However, Van Hollen and other younger members saw Stark's past intemperate comments as a liability to the Democrats in an election year.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/03/04/AR2010030402174.html?hpid=topnews | work=The Washington Post | first=Paul | last=Kane | title=Michigan's Sander Levin replaces Rangel as House Ways and Means chairman | date=March 5, 2010}}</ref>

On April 29, 2010, Van Hollen introduced the campaign finance [[DISCLOSE Act]].<ref>[http://www.thomas.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:h.r.05175: H.R. 5175] [[THOMAS]]</ref> He reintroduced the bill for the 113th Congress on February 9, 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=Van Hollen, House Democrats Introduce DISCLOSE 2012 Act|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140704025410/http://vanhollen.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/van-hollen-house-democrats-introduce-disclose-2012-act|website=vanhollen.house.gov|accessdate=4 July 2014}}</ref>

In April 2011, Van Hollen sued the [[Federal Election Commission]], charging it with [[regulatory capture]] and the creation of a loop hole that allowed unlimited and undisclosed financing in the 2010 election reason.  Had it not been for the loophole, according to  Hollen "much of the more than $135 million in secret contributions that funded expenditures would have been disclosed." <ref>{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/fundraising/157195-top-democrat-sues-federal-election-commission-over-anonymous-donors |title=Top Democrat sues Federal Election Commission over anonymous donors |publisher=The Hill |date=April 21, 2011 |accessdate=2012-08-31}}</ref>

Congressman Van Hollen has been a strong supporter of disability rights, especially for individuals with intellectual disabilities. In 2010 he became a co-chair of the Congressional Down Syndrome Caucus and has sponsored numerous bills that would benefit individuals with disabilities.

==Political campaigns==
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Maryland, 2010#8th Congressional District}}
Prior to Van Hollen's election, incumbent [[Connie Morella]] had won eight elections in the district, despite the fact that she was a Republican in a district where Democrats far outnumbered Republicans. Morella's success was largely attributed to her political independence and relatively [[Liberalism|liberal]] voting record, including support for [[abortion rights]], [[gay rights]], [[gun control]] and increased [[environmentalism|environmental protections]].

After Morella's re-election in 2000, Democratic [[Maryland Senate]] President [[Thomas V. Miller, Jr.|Thomas V. "Mike" Miller]] made no secret that he wanted to draw the 8th out from under Morella. Indeed, one [[redistricting]] plan after the 2000 Census went so far as to divide the 8th in two, giving one district to Van Hollen and forcing Morella to run against popular State Delegate [[Mark Kennedy Shriver]] in November. The final plan was far less ambitious, but made the district even more Democratic by adding heavily Democratic precincts from neighboring [[Prince George's County]], an area that Morella had never represented. It also restored a heavily Democratic spur in eastern Montgomery County that had been cut out in the last round of redistricting.

In 2002, Van Hollen entered a competitive Democratic Party primary against Shriver and former [[Clinton administration]] aide [[Ira Shapiro]]. Though Shriver had the most money, Van Hollen launched a very successful grassroots effort that mobilized Democratic voters. After receiving the endorsement of the ''[[Washington Post]]'', the ''[[Baltimore Sun]]'', and other local papers, Van Hollen defeated Shriver 43.5 percent to 40.6 percent.

During the campaign, Van Hollen emphasized that even when Morella voted with the district, her partisan affiliation kept [[Tom DeLay]] and the rest of her party's more conservative leadership in power. Van Hollen also touted his leadership in the State Senate on issues such as education funding, [[HMO]] reform, [[trigger lock]]s for handguns, and protecting the [[Chesapeake Bay]] from [[oil drilling]]. Ultimately, after a tight race, Van Hollen defeated Morella 51.7 percent to 48.2 percent.<ref name="apsanet.org"/>  Van Hollen crushed Morella in the Prince George's County portion of the district, while narrowly winning Montgomery County.  However, Morella won the precincts she'd previously represented.

Proving just how Democratic this district was, Van Hollen was reelected four times from this district by over 70 percent of the vote.  However, it had long been taken for granted that the Republicans would face extremely long odds of retaking the seat if Morella retired or was defeated in an election.

After the 2010 census, Van Hollen's district was made slightly less Democratic.  He lost a heavily Democratic spur of Montgomery County to the neighboring [[Maryland's 6th congressional district|6th district]], and lost his share of Prince George's County to the [[Maryland's 4th congressional district|4th district]].  In their place, the 8th absorbed heavily  and a strongly Republican spur of Frederick County.  Nonetheless, since his share of Montgomery County has more than double the population of his shares of Carroll and Frederick counties combined, Van Hollen easily won a sixth term over  with 63 percent of the vote.  While Van Hollen lost in Carroll and Frederick, he swamped Timmerman in Montgomery by 113,500 votes.

==Role in the U.S. government shutdown of 2013==
{{main|United States federal government shutdown of 2013}}
According to the [[Huffington Post]], after the [[United States federal government shutdown of 2013|federal government shutdown]] began Van Hollen attempted to reopen the government by bringing a vote to raise the debt ceiling before the entire House. However, he was prevented from doing so by a recent change in rules:
" (R-Utah), presiding over the chamber, told Van Hollen that the rule he was asking to use had been “altered” and he did not have the privilege of bringing that vote to the floor. In the ensuing back and forth, Chaffetz said the recently passed House Resolution 368 trumped the standing rules. Where any member of the House previously could have brought the clean resolution to the floor under House Rule 22, House Resolution 368 — passed on the eve of the shutdown — gave that right exclusively to the House majority leader,  of Virginia.

“The Rules Committee, under the rules of the House, changed the standing rules of the House to take away the right of any member to move to vote to open the government, and gave that right exclusively to the Republican Leader,” said Van Hollen. “Is that right?”

“The House adopted that resolution,” replied Chaffetz.

“I make my motion, Mr. Speaker,” said Van Hollen. “I renew my motion that under the regular standing rules of the House… that the house take up the Senate amendments and open the government now.”

“Under section 2 of H.R. 368, that motion may be offered only by the majority leader or his designee,” Chaffetz said.

“Mr. Speaker, why were the rules rigged to keep the government shut down?” Van Hollen asked.

“The gentleman will suspend,” Chaffetz interjected.

“Democracy has been suspended, Mr. Speaker.”" {(Retrieved from the Huffington Post.)
