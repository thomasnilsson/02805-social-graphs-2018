The district, numbered as the 2nd district from 2001 to 2013, includes portions of northern [[Nassau County, New York|Nassau]] and [[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk]] counties on [[Long Island]], as well as a tiny portion of [[Queens]] in [[New York City]].

==Early life, education, and career==
Israel was born in [[Brooklyn, New York]] and grew up in [[Wantagh]], on Long Island. He graduated from [[Nassau Community College]] and [[George Washington University]]. At George Washington University, he worked as an aide for Robert Matsui and then Richard Ottinger. Israel went on to become Suffok County director of the [[American Jewish Congress]].

He was elected to the town council in [[Huntington, New York]], in 1993. While there, he reportedly convinced the Republican supervisor to switch parties.

;LGBT rights

Israel supports legalizing same sex marriage. In a press release in June 2009, he said “I’m proud of what Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Connecticut and Vermont have done for marriage equality. I hope that my home state of New York will soon follow.” <ref>{{cite web|url=http://israel.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=689%3Acounting-marriage-equality&catid=49%3Ablog&Itemid=1 |title=Counting Marriage Equality |publisher=Israel.house.gov |date=June 17, 2009 |accessdate=May 21, 2013}}</ref> His home state did follow, as [[Same-sex marriage in New York|New York legalized same-sex marriage]] in 2011.

In his second term, Israel was tapped for a leadership position as Assistant [[Whip (politics)|Whip]]. In his third term, Israel was appointed to chair the House Democratic Caucus Task Force on Defense and Military, a group of 15 members of Congress who will outreach to the defense community and advise the House Democratic Leadership on military policy. In 2006, Israel harshly criticized [[Jimmy Carter]] for his book [[Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid]] and at the same time criticized the Palestinian government.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.forward.com/articles/carter-book-slaps-israel-with-%E2%80%98apartheid%E2%80%99-tag/ |title=– The Jewish Daily Forward |publisher=Forward.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

;Occupy Wall Street
Israel's support for [[Occupy Wall Street]] drew criticism from conservatives, who claimed the movement harbored "anti-Semitic" elements. Outraged at this, Israel pointed towards his support for Israel as well as his own Jewish heritage.<ref name="OWS anti-Semitism">{{cite news|title=Steve Israel Furious At Republican Charge That He Embraces Anti-Semitism In Occupy Wall Street|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/10/20/steve-israel-anti-semitism-occupy-wall-street-republican-charge_n_1022579.html|newspaper=The Huffington Post|date=20 October 2011|first=Michael|last=McAuliff}}</ref>

===DCCC chairman===
As an ally of [[Nancy Pelosi]], Israel was mentioned in 2010 as a possible successor to [[Chris Van Hollen]], the then-chairman of the DCCC; he declined to speak about it until after the midterms were over, saying he was "just completely focused on supporting Nancy Pelosi."<ref name="To Chair Campaign Arm">{{cite news|title=Steve Israel to Chair Democratic Campaign Arm|url=http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2010/11/steve-israel-to-chair-democratic-campaign-arm/66840/|newspaper=The Atlantic|date=19 November 2010}}</ref>

It was reported that Pelosi's selection of Israel to head the DCCC had much to do with the district he represents, where "Democrats hold a modest registration edge but independents decide elections." It was noted that Israel had gained respect through fundraising and recruiting candidates for the campaign committee. Israel was one of the few Democrats to run campaign ads in defense of his vote on health care.<ref name="Uphill Charge">{{cite news|title=L.I.

==J Street controversy==
Steve Israel was an honorary member of the gala host committee for a Gala dinner on October 27, 2009 by [[J Street]], a [[Liberalism|liberal]],<ref name="Abramowitz2008-04-15">{{cite news|first=Michael|last=Abramowitz|authorlink=|url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/04/14/AR2008041402647.html|title= Jewish Liberals to Launch A Counterpoint to AIPAC|publisher= The Washington Post|location =|date=April 15, 2008|accessdate=April 29, 2008}}</ref><ref name="Eggen">{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/04/16/AR2009041603995.html |work=The Washington Post |title=Year-Old Liberal Jewish Lobby Has Quickly Made Its Mark |first=Dan |last=Eggen |date=April 17, 2009 |accessdate=May 5, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/washington/articles/2010/02/27/delahunts_journey_to_mideast_upended/ | work=Boston.com | title=Delahunt’s journey to Mideast upended| first=Farah | last=Stockton | date=February 27, 2010 | accessdate=September 22, 2010}}</ref> nonprofit lobbying group. In the weeks leading up to the Gala dinner, those aligned with the [[Likud]], the political party of [[Prime Minister of Israel|Israeli Prime Minister]], [[Benjamin Netanyahu]], criticized Rep. Israel and those supporting J Street. ''[[The Weekly Standard]]'' blogger [[Michael Goldfarb (political writer)|Michael Goldfarb]] called the J Street dinner an "anti-Israel bash."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/10/24/AR2009102400994.html | work=The Washington Post | title=Israel conference to open amid controversy | first=Dan | last=Eggen | date=October 25, 2009 | accessdate=May 24, 2010}}</ref> In response, Lindsay Hamilton, Rep. Israel's spokeswoman said "It's absurd that this has become a controversy...The congressman agreed to be on the gala host committee. That doesn't mean he agrees with every viewpoint of every speaker at the event".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/LandedPages/PrintArticle.aspx?id=158056 |title=Michael Oren rejects J Street conference invite |publisher=Jpost.com |date= |accessdate=May 21, 2013}}</ref>

==Electoral history==
New York election law allows for [[fusion voting]], where a candidate can run as a member of multiple parties. In 2000, Israel ran only as a Democrat in his winning bid for Congress, but since 2002 he has also ran as the candidate for the [[Independence Party of New York|Independence Party]], and the [[Working Families Party]]. In 2000, the Republican candidate ran only as a Republican, but since 2002, every Republican has also run as the candidate for the [[Conservative Party of New York]].

In his second term, Israel was tapped for a leadership position as Assistant [[Whip (politics)|Whip]]. In his third term, Israel was appointed to chair the House Democratic Caucus Task Force on Defense and Military, a group of 15 members of Congress who will outreach to the defense community and advise the House Democratic Leadership on military policy.

;Occupy Wall Street
Israel's support for [[Occupy Wall Street]] drew criticism from conservatives, who claimed the movement harbored "anti-Semitic" elements. Outraged at this, Israel pointed towards his support for Israel as well as his own Jewish heritage.<ref name="OWS anti-Semitism">{{cite news|title=Steve Israel Furious At Republican Charge That He Embraces Anti-Semitism In Occupy Wall Street|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/10/20/steve-israel-anti-semitism-occupy-wall-street-republican-charge_n_1022579.html|newspaper=The Huffington Post|date=20 October 2011|first=Michael|last=McAuliff}}</ref>

===DCCC chairman===
As an ally of [[Nancy Pelosi]], Israel was mentioned in 2010 as a possible successor to [[Chris Van Hollen]], the then-chairman of the DCCC; he declined to speak about it until after the midterms were over, saying he was "just completely focused on supporting Nancy Pelosi."<ref name="To Chair Campaign Arm">{{cite news|title=Steve Israel to Chair Democratic Campaign Arm|url=http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2010/11/steve-israel-to-chair-democratic-campaign-arm/66840/|newspaper=The Atlantic|date=19 November 2010}}</ref>

It was reported that Pelosi's selection of Israel to head the DCCC had much to do with the district he represents, where "Democrats hold a modest registration edge but independents decide elections." It was noted that Israel had gained respect through fundraising and recruiting candidates for the campaign committee. Israel was one of the few Democrats to run campaign ads in defense of his vote on health care.<ref name="Uphill Charge">{{cite news|title=L.I.

==Electoral history==
New York election law allows for [[fusion voting]], where a candidate can run as a member of multiple parties. In 2000, Israel ran only as a Democrat in his winning bid for Congress, but since 2002 he has also ran as the candidate for the [[Independence Party of New York|Independence Party]], and the [[Working Families Party]]. In 2000, the Republican candidate ran only as a Republican, but since 2002, every Republican has also run as the candidate for the [[Conservative Party of New York]].

The district, numbered as the 2nd district from 2001 to 2013, includes portions of northern [[Nassau County, New York|Nassau]] and [[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk]] counties on [[Long Island]], as well as a tiny portion of [[Queens]] in [[New York City]].

==Early life, education, and career==
Israel was born in [[Brooklyn, New York]] and grew up in [[Wantagh]], on Long Island. He graduated from [[Nassau Community College]] and [[George Washington University]]. At George Washington University, he worked as an aide for Robert Matsui and then Richard Ottinger. Israel went on to become Suffok County director of the [[American Jewish Congress]].  In 1987 he unsuccessfully ran for a seat in the county legislature. After this defeat, he spent three years working as an aide to the Suffolk County executive and founded a PR and marketing firm.<ref name="Israel Profile WT">{{cite news|title=Israel (D-NY)|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/steve-israel-d-ny/gIQAt0jCAP_topic.html | work=The Washington Post | date=July 25, 2012}}</ref>

He was elected to the town council in [[Huntington, New York]], in 1993. While there, he reportedly convinced the Republican supervisor to switch parties.

In 2006, Israel harshly criticized [[Jimmy Carter]] for his book [[Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid]] and at the same time criticized the Palestinian government.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.forward.com/articles/carter-book-slaps-israel-with-%E2%80%98apartheid%E2%80%99-tag/ |title=– The Jewish Daily Forward |publisher=Forward.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

;Occupy Wall Street
Israel's support for [[Occupy Wall Street]] drew criticism from conservatives, who claimed the movement harbored "anti-Semitic" elements. Outraged at this, Israel pointed towards his support for Israel as well as his own Jewish heritage.<ref name="OWS anti-Semitism">{{cite news|title=Steve Israel Furious At Republican Charge That He Embraces Anti-Semitism In Occupy Wall Street|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/10/20/steve-israel-anti-semitism-occupy-wall-street-republican-charge_n_1022579.html|newspaper=The Huffington Post|date=20 October 2011|first=Michael|last=McAuliff}}</ref>

===DCCC chairman===
As an ally of [[Nancy Pelosi]], Israel was mentioned in 2010 as a possible successor to [[Chris Van Hollen]], the then-chairman of the DCCC; he declined to speak about it until after the midterms were over, saying he was "just completely focused on supporting Nancy Pelosi."<ref name="To Chair Campaign Arm">{{cite news|title=Steve Israel to Chair Democratic Campaign Arm|url=http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2010/11/steve-israel-to-chair-democratic-campaign-arm/66840/|newspaper=The Atlantic|date=19 November 2010}}</ref>

It was reported that Pelosi's selection of Israel to head the DCCC had much to do with the district he represents, where "Democrats hold a modest registration edge but independents decide elections." It was noted that Israel had gained respect through fundraising and recruiting candidates for the campaign committee. Israel was one of the few Democrats to run campaign ads in defense of his vote on health care.<ref name="Uphill Charge">{{cite news|title=L.I.

==Electoral history==
New York election law allows for [[fusion voting]], where a candidate can run as a member of multiple parties. In 2000, Israel ran only as a Democrat in his winning bid for Congress, but since 2002 he has also ran as the candidate for the [[Independence Party of New York|Independence Party]], and the [[Working Families Party]]. In 2000, the Republican candidate ran only as a Republican, but since 2002, every Republican has also run as the candidate for the [[Conservative Party of New York]].

The district, numbered as the 2nd district from 2001 to 2013, includes portions of northern [[Nassau County, New York|Nassau]] and [[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk]] counties on [[Long Island]], as well as a tiny portion of [[Queens]] in [[New York City]].

He was elected to the town council in [[Huntington, New York]], in 1993. While there, he reportedly convinced the Republican supervisor to switch parties.

==Electoral history==
New York election law allows for [[fusion voting]], where a candidate can run as a member of multiple parties. In 2000, Israel ran only as a Democrat in his winning bid for Congress, but since 2002 he has also ran as the candidate for the [[Independence Party of New York|Independence Party]], and the [[Working Families Party]]. In 2000, the Republican candidate ran only as a Republican, but since 2002, every Republican has also run as the candidate for the [[Conservative Party of New York]].
