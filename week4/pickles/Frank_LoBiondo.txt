It includes all of [[Atlantic County, New Jersey|Atlantic]], [[Cape May County, New Jersey|Cape May]], [[Cumberland County, New Jersey|Cumberland]] and [[Salem County, New Jersey|Salem]] Counties and parts of [[Camden County, New Jersey|Camden]], [[Gloucester County, New Jersey|Gloucester]], [[Burlington County, New Jersey|Burlington]], and [[Ocean County, New Jersey|Ocean]] Counties.

==Early life, education, and business career==
Born in [[Bridgeton, New Jersey]], LoBiondo attended [[Georgetown Preparatory School]], and received a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in Business Administration from [[Saint Joseph's University]] in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]. He worked for twenty-six years in a family-owned trucking company.

==Early political career==
LoBiondo served on the [[Cumberland County, New Jersey|Cumberland County]] [[Board of Chosen Freeholders]] from 1985 to 1987.
