===Elections===
In 1982, incumbent Democratic U.S. Congressman [[William Brodhead]] decided not to run for re-election, instead making an unsuccessful run for governor. Levin won the Democratic primary in [[Michigan's 17th congressional district]] with 49% of the vote,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=225300 |title=MI District 17 - D Primary Race - Aug 03, 1982 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=December 21, 2011}}</ref> which at that time included northwestern Detroit as well as parts of Macomb and Oakland counties.

After the [[1990 United States Census]], his district was renumbered as the 12th district and lost its share of Detroit. In 1992, he narrowly defeated businessman and [[Vietnam War]] veteran [[John Pappageorge]] 53%-46%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=28019 |title=MI District 12 Race - Nov 03, 1992 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=December 21, 2011}}</ref> In a 1994 rematch, Levin again defeated this same opponent, during the midst of the [[Republican Revolution]], 52%-47%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=28905 |title=MI District 12 Race - Nov 08, 1994 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=December 21, 2011}}</ref> Then again in 1996, Levin defeated Pappageorge by a larger margin in a third rematch 57%-41%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=29544 |title=MI District 12 Race - Nov 05, 1996 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=December 21, 2011}}</ref> In 1998, Levin won re-election against Republican nominee Leslie A.

After redistricting, Levin was drawn into the same district as fellow U.S. Congressman [[Gary Peters (Michigan politician)|Gary Peters]] (D-MI).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2011/06/sander_levin_pans_republican_r.html |title=Sander Levin pans Republican redistricting map |publisher=MLive.com |agency=Associated Press |date=June 28, 2011 |accessdate=December 21, 2011}}</ref>  The district retained Peters' district number—the 9th—but geographically is more Levin's district.  Peters opted to run in the newly redrawn [[Michigan's 14th congressional district|14th District]].<ref>{{cite news|last=McCarty|first=Alicia| url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/story/2011-11-02/2012-elections-preview-midwest/51128656/1 | work=USA Today | title=A look ahead to the key races in the Midwest in 2012 | date=November 8, 2011}}</ref> In 2008, Obama won the 9th district with 59% of the vote, while he won statewide with 57%. Levin now represents the 12th congressional district which picks up Oak Park, [[Berkley, Michigan|Berkley]], [[Madison Heights, Michigan|Madison Heights]], [[Clawson, Michigan|Clawson]], Royal Oak, and Troy, but former portions were moved over into the adjacent 11th District to the west to now include [[Southfield Township, Michigan|Southfield Township]], Beverly Hills, [[Bloomfield Township, Oakland County, Michigan|Bloomfield Township]] Birmingham, and portions of Royal Oak.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://republicanmichigander.blogspot.com/2011/06/congressional-district-9-redistricting.html |title=Congressional District 9 - Redistricting (MI-09) |publisher=Republican Michigander |date=June 30, 2011 |accessdate=December 21, 2011}}</ref>

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
In 1982, incumbent Democratic U.S. Congressman [[William Brodhead]] decided not to run for re-election, instead making an unsuccessful run for governor. Levin won the Democratic primary in [[Michigan's 17th congressional district]] with 49% of the vote,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=225300 |title=MI District 17 - D Primary Race - Aug 03, 1982 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=December 21, 2011}}</ref> which at that time included northwestern Detroit as well as parts of Macomb and Oakland counties. Levin subsequently won this 1982 general election with 67% of the vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=37150 |title=MI District 17 Race - Nov 02, 1982 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=December 21, 2011}}</ref> He typically won re-election with at least 56% of the vote since then, exceptions being 1992 and 1994 elections. After the [[1990 United States Census]], his district was renumbered as the 12th district and lost its share of Detroit. In 1992, he narrowly defeated businessman and [[Vietnam War]] veteran [[John Pappageorge]] 53%-46%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=28019 |title=MI District 12 Race - Nov 03, 1992 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=December 21, 2011}}</ref> In a 1994 rematch, Levin again defeated this same opponent, during the midst of the [[Republican Revolution]], 52%-47%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=28905 |title=MI District 12 Race - Nov 08, 1994 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=December 21, 2011}}</ref> Then again in 1996, Levin defeated Pappageorge by a larger margin in a third rematch 57%-41%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=29544 |title=MI District 12 Race - Nov 05, 1996 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=December 21, 2011}}</ref> In 1998, Levin won re-election against Republican nominee Leslie A. Touma, 56%-42%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=30690 |title=MI District 12 Race - Nov 03, 1998 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=December 21, 2011}}</ref> In 2000, Detroit Metro area businessman Bart Baron gained the endorsement of the [[United Auto Workers]] Union, but Levin still managed to win re-election with 64% of the vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=510 |title=MI District 12 Race - Nov 07, 2000 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=December 21, 2011}}</ref> The 2000s redistricting added heavily Democratic Southfield and Mount Clemens to the district, and he has won re-election in every election with at least 61% of the vote since then.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/CandidateDetail.html?CandidateID=1272 |title=Candidate - Sander Levin |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=December 21, 2011}}</ref>

After redistricting, Levin was drawn into the same district as fellow U.S. Congressman [[Gary Peters (Michigan politician)|Gary Peters]] (D-MI).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2011/06/sander_levin_pans_republican_r.html |title=Sander Levin pans Republican redistricting map |publisher=MLive.com |agency=Associated Press |date=June 28, 2011 |accessdate=December 21, 2011}}</ref>  The district retained Peters' district number—the 9th—but geographically is more Levin's district.  Peters opted to run in the newly redrawn [[Michigan's 14th congressional district|14th District]].<ref>{{cite news|last=McCarty|first=Alicia| url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/story/2011-11-02/2012-elections-preview-midwest/51128656/1 | work=USA Today | title=A look ahead to the key races in the Midwest in 2012 | date=November 8, 2011}}</ref> In 2008, Obama won the 9th district with 59% of the vote, while he won statewide with 57%. Levin now represents the 12th congressional district which picks up Oak Park, [[Berkley, Michigan|Berkley]], [[Madison Heights, Michigan|Madison Heights]], [[Clawson, Michigan|Clawson]], Royal Oak, and Troy, but former portions were moved over into the adjacent 11th District to the west to now include [[Southfield Township, Michigan|Southfield Township]], Beverly Hills, [[Bloomfield Township, Oakland County, Michigan|Bloomfield Township]] Birmingham, and portions of Royal Oak.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://republicanmichigander.blogspot.com/2011/06/congressional-district-9-redistricting.html |title=Congressional District 9 - Redistricting (MI-09) |publisher=Republican Michigander |date=June 30, 2011 |accessdate=December 21, 2011}}</ref>
