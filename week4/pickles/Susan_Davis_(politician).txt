In 2000, Davis challenged three-term [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] incumbent [[Brian Bilbray]] in what was then the 49th District, winning with 50 percent of the vote.

In 2000, Davis challenged three-term [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] incumbent [[Brian Bilbray]] in what was then the 49th District, winning with 50 percent of the vote.

She is the first [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] to represent what is now the 53rd district for more than one term in over half a century.
