==Early life, education and career==
Foxx was born in [[The Bronx, New York]] to Dollie (née Garrison) and Nunzio John Palmieri. She was reared in a rural area of [[Avery County, North Carolina]]. Foxx grew up in a poor family and first lived in a home with running water and electricity at 14 years old.<ref name="news and observer">{{cite web|title=Virginia Foxx|url=http://projects.newsobserver.com/dome/profiles/virginia_foxx|work=Raleigh News & Observer|accessdate=March 28, 2012}}</ref> 

While attending Crossnore High School in [[Crossnore, North Carolina]], she worked as a janitor at the school and was the first in her family to graduate from high school.<ref>{{cite web|title=Celebrities, Notable Public Figures Reveal Their Most Memorable Teachers|url=http://www.nea.org/grants/17345.htm|publisher=National Education Association}}</ref> She graduated from the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] with a bachelor's degree in 1968 and later earned both a [[Master of Arts]] in college teaching (1972) and [[Ed.D]] (1985) from the [[University of North Carolina at Greensboro]].<ref name="Bioguide"/><ref name="About Foxx">{{cite web|title=About Virginia Foxx|url=http://virginiafoxx.com/about|publisher=VirginiaFoxx.com|accessdate=March 28, 2012}}</ref> With her husband, Virginia Foxx owned and operated a [[Plant nursery|nursery]] and [[landscaping]] business.<ref name="About Foxx"/>

===Political campaigns===

====Republican Primary 2003-2004====
{{BLP unsourced section|date=November 2009}}
After 5th District Congressman [[Richard Burr]] decided he would run for the [[United States Senate]], Foxx was first to join the race for congressman. North Carolina's 5th district is highly partisan. Because of this, the race quickly became one of the most expensive in North Carolina's history.

====General election campaigns====
[[File:Virginia Foxx 2009.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Virginia Foxx |Virginia Foxx talking with constituents in Yadkinville, NC]]
In contrast to the primary, her general election campaign against [[Jim Harrell, Jr.]], which she easily won (59%-41%), was more cordial.

Foxx was briefly targeted for defeat in the [[United States House of Representatives elections in North Carolina, 2006|2006 elections]], but the [[United States Democratic Party|Democrats]]' top choice, popular Winston-Salem mayor [[Allen Joines]], decided not to run. Joines later said that he didn't have the stomach for the kind of race he felt it would take to defeat Foxx.<ref>[http://www.journalnow.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=WSJ%2FMGArticle%2FWSJ_ColumnistArticle&c=MGArticle&cid=1128769268868&path=!localnews&s=1037645509099]{{Dead link|date=September 2008}}</ref> Her 2006 opponent was [[Roger Sharpe]], who was defeated.
Roy Carter of [[Ashe County, North Carolina]] was Foxx's opponent for her seat in the 2008 election; she won by a substantial margin.

In November 2010, Foxx was reelected with about 65% of the vote.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://elections.nytimes.com/2010/results/house | work=The New York Times | title=House Results Map}}</ref>

In November 2014, Foxx was reelected with about 60% of the vote defeating "software developer Josh Brannon of Vilas." <ref>{{cite news| url=

===Tenure===

====Hurricane Katrina====
In September 2005, Foxx was one of 11 members of Congress to vote against<ref>{{cite news|last=McMurray|first=Jeffrey|title=Representatives stand by their votes against hurricane aid|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=L-kvAAAAIBAJ&sjid=8jsDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4966,7230333&dq=katrina+virginia-foxx&hl=en|newspaper=Rome News-Tribune|date=September 22, 2005}}</ref> the $51 billion aid package to victims of [[Hurricane Katrina]].

====Heroes Earned Retirement Opportunities (HERO) Act====
The first bill sponsored by Foxx to have been signed into law since 2006, the Hero Act, signed by President Bush on Memorial Day, 2006, allows U.S. troops to increase their retirement savings by investing a portion of their combat pay into [[Individual Retirement Account]]s.

====Electronic Pay Stub Act====
The second bill sponsored by Foxx and subsequently signed into law is the Electronic Pay Stub Act which gives federal employees the choice of receiving their pay stubs electronically. This legislation is projected to save taxpayers millions of dollars. Studies have shown that it costs 10 times more to purchase and distribute paper stubs than it does to distribute electronic stubs.<ref>Hicks, Adam. [http://www.goblueridge.net/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=4229&Itemid=1 "Foxx-Authored Bill Passes in Congress"]. ''GoBlueRidge.net''.

====Troubled Asset Relief Program====
Shortly after Congress approved the Troubled Asset Relief Program, Foxx identified a provision in the law that allowed her to force consideration of a measure to deny the second, $350 billion, tranche of the TARP bailout. On November 19, 2008, she introduced H.J.Res. 101, which met all of the parliamentary requirements for consideration once the President requested the second tranche. {{cn|date=October 2014}}

In the following (111th) Congress, she reintroduced the measure as H.J. Res. 3, and shortly before leaving office, President Bush requested the second tranche, thereby activating the trigger allowing her to commandeer the House floor, although she was not a member of the majority party. Her measure passed the House 270-155; the act was never addressed in the Senate.<ref>Sec. 115 of PL 110-343</ref> 

During an interview in 2007, Foxx was quoted as saying: [http://www.tc-america.org/in-congress/congresswoman-virginia-foxx-to-young-turks-72.htm "We have the best economy we have had in 50 years."]

====Opposition to Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act====
In April 2009, Foxx expressed opposition to the [[Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act]], claiming that the murder of [[Matthew Shepard]] was not a hate crime. While debating the act at the House of Representatives, she called the murder a "very unfortunate incident" but claimed "we know that that young man was killed in the commitment of a robbery. It wasn't because he was gay." She ultimately called that allegation "a hoax that that continues to be used as an excuse for passing [[hate crimes]] bills."<ref>{{cite news | last =Mary Ann | first =Akers | title =Virginia Foxx: Matthew Shepard's Murder Not a Hate Crime | publisher =Washington Post | date =2009-04-29 | url =http://voices.washingtonpost.com/sleuth/2009/04/virginia_foxx_mathew_shepards.html | accessdate =2009-05-20 }}</ref>

====Health care debate====
When commenting on the House version of the reform bill that funds counseling for end-of-life issues, Foxx said, "Republicans have a better solution that won't put the government in charge of people's health care," and "(The plan) is pro-life because it will not put seniors in a position of being put to death by their government."<ref name="fox_july30_2009">{{cite web|url=http://www.myfox8.com/wghp-foxx-health-care-comments-090730,0,2622612.story|title=Virginia Foxx Uses Strong Words to Oppose Health Care Reform Bill|last=Tucker|first=Chad|date=July 30, 2009|work=MyFox8.com|accessdate=2009-08-09}}</ref> She later said that "we have more to fear from the potential of the [[Affordable Health Care for America Act]] passing than we do from any terrorist right now in any country."<ref name="mediamatters_nov02_2009">{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA66v858_NU&feature=player_embedded|title=Rep.

====Turkish American Caucus====
Virginia Foxx is a member of [[Congressional Caucus on Turkey and Turkish Americans]] since 2005. Her son-in-law is a Turkish businessman, Mustafa Özdemir.<ref>http://www.turkishcoalition.org/young_turks%20_080807.html</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Taniş|first=Tolga|title=Ermeni tasarısı iki yıl yok|url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/dunya/16693239.asp?top=1|newspaper=Hürriyet|date=6 January 2011|language=Turkish}}</ref>

====Opposition to birthright citizenship====
In January 2013, Foxx co-sponsored legislation that would stop children born in the United States to undocumented parents from gaining citizenship.<ref>{{cite news | first = Elise | last = Foley | title = Steve King Introduces Bill To Stop 'Anchor Babies' | date = January 4, 2013 | url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/04/steve-king-anchor-babies_n_2411989.html | work = [[The Huffington Post]] | accessdate = January 7, 2013}}</ref>

====Troubled Asset Relief Program====
Shortly after Congress approved the Troubled Asset Relief Program, Foxx identified a provision in the law that allowed her to force consideration of a measure to deny the second, $350 billion, tranche of the TARP bailout.

In the following (111th) Congress, she reintroduced the measure as H.J. Res. 3, and shortly before leaving office, President Bush requested the second tranche, thereby activating the trigger allowing her to commandeer the House floor, although she was not a member of the majority party. Her measure passed the House 270-155; the act was never addressed in the Senate.<ref>Sec. 115 of PL 110-343</ref> 

During an interview in 2007, Foxx was quoted as saying: [http://www.tc-america.org/in-congress/congresswoman-virginia-foxx-to-young-turks-72.htm "We have the best economy we have had in 50 years."]

==Early life, education and career==
Foxx was born in [[The Bronx, New York]] to Dollie (née Garrison) and Nunzio John Palmieri. She was reared in a rural area of [[Avery County, North Carolina]]. Foxx grew up in a poor family and first lived in a home with running water and electricity at 14 years old.<ref name="news and observer">{{cite web|title=Virginia Foxx|url=http://projects.newsobserver.com/dome/profiles/virginia_foxx|work=Raleigh News & Observer|accessdate=March 28, 2012}}</ref>

===Political campaigns===

====Republican Primary 2003-2004====
{{BLP unsourced section|date=November 2009}}
After 5th District Congressman [[Richard Burr]] decided he would run for the [[United States Senate]], Foxx was first to join the race for congressman. North Carolina's 5th district is highly partisan. Because of this, the race quickly became one of the most expensive in North Carolina's history.

====General election campaigns====
[[File:Virginia Foxx 2009.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Virginia Foxx |Virginia Foxx talking with constituents in Yadkinville, NC]]
In contrast to the primary, her general election campaign against [[Jim Harrell, Jr.]], which she easily won (59%-41%), was more cordial.

Foxx was briefly targeted for defeat in the [[United States House of Representatives elections in North Carolina, 2006|2006 elections]], but the [[United States Democratic Party|Democrats]]' top choice, popular Winston-Salem mayor [[Allen Joines]], decided not to run. Joines later said that he didn't have the stomach for the kind of race he felt it would take to defeat Foxx.<ref>[http://www.journalnow.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=WSJ%2FMGArticle%2FWSJ_ColumnistArticle&c=MGArticle&cid=1128769268868&path=!localnews&s=1037645509099]{{Dead link|date=September 2008}}</ref> Her 2006 opponent was [[Roger Sharpe]], who was defeated.
Roy Carter of [[Ashe County, North Carolina]] was Foxx's opponent for her seat in the 2008 election; she won by a substantial margin.

In November 2010, Foxx was reelected with about 65% of the vote.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://elections.nytimes.com/2010/results/house | work=The New York Times | title=House Results Map}}</ref>

In November 2014, Foxx was reelected with about 60% of the vote defeating "software developer Josh Brannon of Vilas." <ref>{{cite news| url=

==Early life, education and career==
Foxx was born in [[The Bronx, New York]] to Dollie (née Garrison) and Nunzio John Palmieri. She was reared in a rural area of [[Avery County, North Carolina]]. Foxx grew up in a poor family and first lived in a home with running water and electricity at 14 years old.<ref name="news and observer">{{cite web|title=Virginia Foxx|url=http://projects.newsobserver.com/dome/profiles/virginia_foxx|work=Raleigh News & Observer|accessdate=March 28, 2012}}</ref> 

While attending Crossnore High School in [[Crossnore, North Carolina]], she worked as a janitor at the school and was the first in her family to graduate from high school.<ref>{{cite web|title=Celebrities, Notable Public Figures Reveal Their Most Memorable Teachers|url=http://www.nea.org/grants/17345.htm|publisher=National Education Association}}</ref> She graduated from the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] with a bachelor's degree in 1968 and later earned both a [[Master of Arts]] in college teaching (1972) and [[Ed.D]] (1985) from the [[University of North Carolina at Greensboro]].<ref name="Bioguide"/><ref name="About Foxx">{{cite web|title=About Virginia Foxx|url=http://virginiafoxx.com/about|publisher=VirginiaFoxx.com|accessdate=March 28, 2012}}</ref> With her husband, Virginia Foxx owned and operated a [[Plant nursery|nursery]] and [[landscaping]] business.<ref name="About Foxx"/>

Foxx worked as a research assistant and then an English instructor at [[Caldwell Community College & Technical Institute]] and [[Appalachian State University]] before moving into university administration. From 1987 until her 1994 entry into politics, she was president of Mayland Community College. Under North Carolina Governor [[James G. Martin]], Foxx served as Deputy Secretary for Management.<ref name="About Foxx"/> From 1994 to 2004, Foxx served in the [[North Carolina Senate]]. {{cn|date=October 2014}}

==United States House of Representatives==

===Committee assignments===
* '''[[United States House Committee on Education and the Workforce|Committee on Education and the Workforce]]'''
** [[United States House Education Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary and Secondary Education|Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary and Secondary Education]]
** [[United States House Education Subcommittee on Higher Education and Workforce Training|Subcommittee on Higher Education and Workforce Training]] (Chairwoman)

* [[Italian American Congressional Delegation]]

===Political campaigns===

====Republican Primary 2003-2004====
{{BLP unsourced section|date=November 2009}}
After 5th District Congressman [[Richard Burr]] decided he would run for the [[United States Senate]], Foxx was first to join the race for congressman. North Carolina's 5th district is highly partisan. Because of this, the race quickly became one of the most expensive in North Carolina's history.

====General election campaigns====
[[File:Virginia Foxx 2009.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Virginia Foxx |Virginia Foxx talking with constituents in Yadkinville, NC]]
In contrast to the primary, her general election campaign against [[Jim Harrell, Jr.]], which she easily won (59%-41%), was more cordial.

Foxx was briefly targeted for defeat in the [[United States House of Representatives elections in North Carolina, 2006|2006 elections]], but the [[United States Democratic Party|Democrats]]' top choice, popular Winston-Salem mayor [[Allen Joines]], decided not to run. Joines later said that he didn't have the stomach for the kind of race he felt it would take to defeat Foxx.<ref>[http://www.journalnow.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=WSJ%2FMGArticle%2FWSJ_ColumnistArticle&c=MGArticle&cid=1128769268868&path=!localnews&s=1037645509099]{{Dead link|date=September 2008}}</ref> Her 2006 opponent was [[Roger Sharpe]], who was defeated.
Roy Carter of [[Ashe County, North Carolina]] was Foxx's opponent for her seat in the 2008 election; she won by a substantial margin.

In November 2010, Foxx was reelected with about 65% of the vote.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://elections.nytimes.com/2010/results/house | work=The New York Times | title=House Results Map}}</ref>

In November 2014, Foxx was reelected with about 60% of the vote defeating "software developer Josh Brannon of Vilas." <ref>{{cite news| url=
http://centralnc.twcnews.com/content/politics/713619/us-rep--foxx-wins-6th-term-in-nc-s-5th-district/ }}</ref>

===Tenure===

====Hurricane Katrina====
In September 2005, Foxx was one of 11 members of Congress to vote against<ref>{{cite news|last=McMurray|first=Jeffrey|title=Representatives stand by their votes against hurricane aid|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=L-kvAAAAIBAJ&sjid=8jsDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4966,7230333&dq=katrina+virginia-foxx&hl=en|newspaper=Rome News-Tribune|date=September 22, 2005}}</ref> the $51 billion aid package to victims of [[Hurricane Katrina]].

====Heroes Earned Retirement Opportunities (HERO) Act====
The first bill sponsored by Foxx to have been signed into law since 2006, the Hero Act, signed by President Bush on Memorial Day, 2006, allows U.S. troops to increase their retirement savings by investing a portion of their combat pay into [[Individual Retirement Account]]s.

====Electronic Pay Stub Act====
The second bill sponsored by Foxx and subsequently signed into law is the Electronic Pay Stub Act which gives federal employees the choice of receiving their pay stubs electronically. This legislation is projected to save taxpayers millions of dollars. Studies have shown that it costs 10 times more to purchase and distribute paper stubs than it does to distribute electronic stubs.<ref>Hicks, Adam. [http://www.goblueridge.net/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=4229&Itemid=1 "Foxx-Authored Bill Passes in Congress"]. ''GoBlueRidge.net''. July 31, 2008.</ref> This bill was signed into law in October, 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goblueridge.net/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=4810&Itemid=1 |title=Foxx’s Legislation Signed into Law |publisher=Goblueridge.net |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref>

====Troubled Asset Relief Program====
Shortly after Congress approved the Troubled Asset Relief Program, Foxx identified a provision in the law that allowed her to force consideration of a measure to deny the second, $350 billion, tranche of the TARP bailout. On November 19, 2008, she introduced H.J.Res. 101, which met all of the parliamentary requirements for consideration once the President requested the second tranche. {{cn|date=October 2014}}

In the following (111th) Congress, she reintroduced the measure as H.J. Res. 3, and shortly before leaving office, President Bush requested the second tranche, thereby activating the trigger allowing her to commandeer the House floor, although she was not a member of the majority party. Her measure passed the House 270-155; the act was never addressed in the Senate.<ref>Sec. 115 of PL 110-343</ref> 

During an interview in 2007, Foxx was quoted as saying: [http://www.tc-america.org/in-congress/congresswoman-virginia-foxx-to-young-turks-72.htm "We have the best economy we have had in 50 years."]

====Opposition to Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act====
In April 2009, Foxx expressed opposition to the [[Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act]], claiming that the murder of [[Matthew Shepard]] was not a hate crime. While debating the act at the House of Representatives, she called the murder a "very unfortunate incident" but claimed "we know that that young man was killed in the commitment of a robbery. It wasn't because he was gay." She ultimately called that allegation "a hoax that that continues to be used as an excuse for passing [[hate crimes]] bills."<ref>{{cite news | last =Mary Ann | first =Akers | title =Virginia Foxx: Matthew Shepard's Murder Not a Hate Crime | publisher =Washington Post | date =2009-04-29 | url =http://voices.washingtonpost.com/sleuth/2009/04/virginia_foxx_mathew_shepards.html | accessdate =2009-05-20 }}</ref>
