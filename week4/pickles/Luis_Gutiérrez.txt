==Early life, education, and early career==
Gutiérrez was born and raised in the [[Lincoln Park, Chicago|Lincoln Park]] neighborhood of Chicago, then an immigrant and working class community.  His mother was an assembly-line worker and his father was a cab driver. After his freshman year at St. Michael's High School, his parents moved the family to their hometown of [[San Sebastián, Puerto Rico]]. Gutiérrez, who had never before visited the island, reluctantly followed his parents; there he learned to speak Spanish.  Gutiérrez said of his experience moving from Chicago to Puerto Rico: "In Lincoln Park, I had been called a spic, then all of a sudden I land on the island and everyone calls me ''gringo'' and ''Americanito''. I learned to speak Spanish well."<ref name="articles.chicagotribune.com"/>  

In 1974 Gutiérrez returned to Chicago and enrolled at [[Northeastern Illinois University]].  He got involved in student activism and [[social justice]] issues, writing for the student publication ''Que Ondee Sola'' and serving as the president of the Union for Puerto Rican Students.<ref>{{cite news|title=Candidates Go Heavy On Insults|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1986-04-26/news/8601300366_1_faln-puerto-rican-community-puerto-rico|publisher=''Chicago Tribune''|accessdate=July 5, 2011|author=Jack Houston|date=April 26, 1986}}</ref>  In 1976, while a senior at Northeastern, he began driving a cab in order to raise enough funds to visit his longtime girlfriend, Soraida, in Puerto Rico. In 1977, after graduating from Northeastern Illinois University with a degree in English he returned to Puerto Rico and married Soraida.  The couple returned to Chicago in 1978 and, unable to find other work,  Gutiérrez took up taxi driving full-time.<ref>{{cite news| title=Taking a Taxi to the House of Representatives| url=http://www.rollcall.com/issues/57_2/taking-a-taxi-to-the-house-of-representatives-207041-1.html?zkMobileView=false|date=2011-07-06|accessdate=2011-07-06|first=Alexandra|last=Jaffe|work= Roll Call}}</ref> Gutiérrez eventually found work as a [[Chicago Public School]] teacher and later a [[child abuse]] [[Caseworker (social work)|caseworker]] with the Illinois Department of Children & Family Services.<ref name="house.gov">{{cite web|title=Official Biography |url=http://gutierrez.house.gov/about-me/full-biography|publisher=house.gov|accessdate=June 22, 2013}}</ref>

==Early political career==

===Campaign for 32nd ward Democratic committeeman===
In 1983 Gutiérrez left his job with the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services to run against incumbent [[Dan Rostenkowski]] for 32nd ward Democratic committeeman in the March 1984 primary election.  To fund his campaign Gutiérrez returned to driving a cab seven days a week, 14 hours a day. Gutiérrez's work as a taxi driver grew his campaign fund to $6,000, against which Rostenkowski had hundreds of thousands of dollars.  Reporting on Gutiérrez's early political career, Jorge Casuso and Ben Joravsky of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' wrote: Gutiérrez thought he could win.  Washington's 1983 victory – the first local race Gutiérrez had voted in – had left him wildly optimistic.  Before that, he didn't think blacks, Hispanics and poor people could win a legitimate voice in local government."<ref name="articles.chicagotribune.com"/> 

Relying on his family and friends as campaign staff, Gutiérrez opened up his campaign office on North California Ave in Chicago's [[Humboldt Park, Chicago|Humboldt Park neighborhood]].  Gutiérrez collected over three-fourths of the 2,200 signatures he needed to quality for the ballot on his own.  Rostenkowski, then a twelve-term Congressman and Chair of the powerful [[United States House Committee on Ways and Means|House Ways & Means Committee]] soundly defeated Gutiérrez, with 76% of the vote.<ref name="articles.chicagotribune.com"/>

===Adviser to Harold Washington===
Following Gutiérrez's loss to Dan Rostenkowski he helped found the [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]] Coalition for New Politics in spring of 1984.  The coalition was meant to be a grassroots, independent, and multiracial counterweight to the [[Cook County Democratic Party]].<ref name="Marable 1998">{{cite book |last= Marable |first=Manning |title=Black leadership |publisher=[[Columbia University Press]] |year=1998 }}</ref>

Gutiérrez's political activism and role as a rising leader in Chicago's burgeoning Latino community caught the attention of Chicago's first African-American Mayor – Harold Washington – who appointed him in August 1984 to the position of deputy superintendent in the [[Law and Government of Chicago|Department of Streets and Sanitation]].<ref name="articles.chicagotribune.com"/>  

Gutiérrez served as a deputy superintendent in the Washington administration and as an administrative assistant to the Mayor – serving on the Mayor's committee on infrastructure.<ref name="Fremon 1988">{{cite book |last=Fremon |first=David |title=Chicago politics, ward by ward |publisher=[[Indiana University Press]] |year=1988 }}</ref>  

In October 1984 a [[Molotov cocktail]] came crashing through the front living room window of Gutiérrez's home.  For a period of three months following the firebombing his family lived in hotel rooms.  The offenders were never identified, but Gutiérrez attributed the attack to "culprits from the right... opposed to reform and Mayor Washington."<ref name="articles.chicagotribune.com"/>  

In July 1985, in an effort to support Washington's political reform movement, Gutiérrez founded the [[West Town, Chicago|West Town]]-26th Ward Independent Political Organization (IPO).  Like the Cook County Coalition for New Politics, the organization aimed to bring together residents of all races in support of progressive reform in Chicago. The Mayor attended the organization's kick-off event, at which 100 names were added to the mailing list and $5,000 was raised.<ref name="articles.chicagotribune.com"/>

===1986 Aldermanic election===
[[File:Luis Gutierrez and Mayor Harold Washington.jpg|thumb|Mayor [[Harold Washington]] was a key backer of Gutierrez's 1986 bid for 26th ward alderman.]]
In December 1985, as a result of a November 1985 ward remap, district court judge [[Charles Ronald Norgle, Sr.|Charles Norgle]] ordered a special election for March 18, 1986 in seven wards, including the 26th.<ref name="Fremon 1988"/> The incumbent alderman of the 26th ward, Michael Nardulli, an Italian-American, chose not to seek re-election in the newly drawn majority Latino district.  Gutiérrez declared his candidacy for alderman of the 26th ward and soon received the endorsement of Mayor Harold Washington.  At the time of the election opponents to Washington's administration, led by [[Edward Vrdolyak|Ed Vrdolyak]] of the 10th ward, controlled the City Council.  This divide within city government was dubbed by the Chicago media as [[Council Wars]].  The 1986 special elections gave Washington the opportunity to take control of the city council.  Because the six other special elections were all but decided, control of the council came down to the race in the 26th ward.  [[Manuel Torres]], then a member of the Democratic machine and Cook County Commissioner also entered the race for 26th ward Alderman.  Torres was endorsed by Vrdolyak, former mayor [[Jane Byrne]], future mayor and then State's Attorney [[Richard M. Daley]], and machine Alderman [[Edward M. Burke|Ed Burke]] and [[Richard Mell|Dick Mell]].<ref name="Fremon 1988"/>  

Gutiérrez's campaign volunteers were primarily women,"ex-hippies and... community activists-black, white and Hispanic."<ref name="articles.chicagotribune.com"/>  With the campaign theme: "Church, Family, Community," support from Mayor Harold Washington – who donated $12,000 to Gutiérrez – and the now 250 members of the West Town-26th Ward Independent Political Organization as volunteers, Gutiérrez bested Torres by 22 votes, a margin not large enough to avoid a run-off against Torres.<ref name="Marable 1998"/><ref>{{cite news|publisher=The Chicago Tribune|author=Gibson, Ray|title=Mayor Helped Fund Candidates| date=1986-04-16}}</ref>

On the eve of the Gutiérrez-Torres run-off Spanish language television aired the candidates' final debate.  Gutiérrez, who spoke Spanish during the debate, outperformed Torres, who chose to speak entirely in English. Gutiérrez's use of Spanish and his grassroots organizing are credited for his 53%–47% victory over Torres.  Gutiérrez is reported to have said during the election: "My supporters could give a damn about the Democratic Party.  They're ready to work on whatever it is that moves socioeconomic justice ahead."<ref name="Marable 1998"/><ref name="Fremon 1988"/>

===Chicago City Council===
Upon entering the [[Chicago City Council]] Gutiérrez, representing the 26th Ward, became Mayor Harold Washington's unofficial floor leader and leader of the Latinos in the council.<ref name="Fremon 1988"/>   Gutiérrez said of his role as unofficial Washington spokesman: "There are only six or seven of us of the twenty-five [pro-Washington alderman] that say anything.  You could say there's only six or seven that have big mouths and want to talk all the time.  But I figured it out-there's only six or seven of us that Eddie Vrdolyak doesn't have anything on,  that Eddie Vrdolyak hasn't done a favor for, that Eddie Vrdolyak hasn't taken care of some problem,  that Eddie Vrdolyak doesn't have some dirt on.  So when you want to get up and take Eddie on, you got to be clean."<ref name="Fremon 1988"/>

As a member of the city council Gutiérrez was a key backer of the 1986 gay rights ordinance – which sought to ban discrimination based upon gender & sexual orientation.   He was also a proponent of local economic development and construction of affordable housing.  He was referred to as a "workhorse in the city council" by political author Marable Manning.<ref name="Fremon 1988"/>  

In the 1987 municipal elections Gutiérrez faced five opponents and be re-elected to the City Council with 66% of the vote.<ref name="Fremon 1988"/> Following Washington's death and the battle over who would succeed the deceased Mayor, Gutiérrez voted for African-American Alderman [[Timothy C. Evans]] over machine-backed Alderman [[Eugene Sawyer]].  In the 1989 Mayoral election Gutiérrez endorsed State's Attorney [[Richard M. Daley]] for Mayor, stating: "I will have a great influence in determining the thrust and tone of the Daley administration`s progressive and liberal agendas."<ref>{{cite news|publisher=The Chicago Tribune|author=Casuso, Jorge|title=Gutierrez`s Turnabout Has Heads Spinning|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1989-02-13/news/8903040994_1_gutierrez-alderman-timothy-evans|date=1989-02-13}}</ref>

Under Daley's administration Gutiérrez served as Chair of the Committee on Housing, Land Acquisition, Disposition and Leases and Council President [[pro tempore]], presiding over meetings in the Mayor's absence.<ref name="articles.chicagotribune.com"/>

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
;Election (1992)
In 1990 a court order created a new "[[earmuff|earmuff-shaped]]" majority Latino congressional district, with two main sections in Chicago connected by a thin corridor in the suburbs.  Four candidates announced their intention to run in the 1992 Democratic primary – Gutiérrez, Alderman [[Richard Mell|Dick Mell]] of the 33rd ward, then Cook County Board of Appeals Commissioner [[Joseph Berrios]], and [[Juan Soliz]], former Alderman of 25th ward.<ref name="Kass, John">{{cite news |author= Kass, John |date=1991-12-10 |title=Gutierrez Picks Up Daley`s Backing For Congress |work=Chicago Tribune |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1991-12-10/news/9104210061_1_alderman-mayor-richard-daley-hispanic }}</ref>  Mell, the only white candidate entered the race out of his "personal dislike for Gutiérrez." <ref name="Davis, Robert">{{cite news |author= Davis, Robert |date=1991-12-18 |title=Hispanics Urge Mell To Withdraw, But Soliz Disagrees |work=Chicago Tribune |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1991-12-18/news/9104230484_1_hispanic-leaders-richard-mell-alderman}}</ref> Gutiérrez received the endorsement of Mayor Richard M.

Despite the district's majority [[Mexican-American]] population and Soliz's highly negative campaign, Gutiérrez won the Democratic primary 60%-40%.<ref name="Davis, Robert"/><ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=437692</ref><ref name="Ortiz, Lou">{{cite news |author= Ortiz, Lou |date=1992-03-18 |title=Gutierrez coasts toward big win in Hispanic district race |work=Chicago Tribune |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4101228.html}}</ref>  At his election night victory party Gutiérrez stated: "If a Puerto Rican kid from Humboldt Park can go to the Congress of the United States, it shows the American dream is possible."<ref name="Ortiz, Lou"/> [[Billy Ocasio]] was later tapped to replace Gutierrez in the Chicago City Council in January 1993. In the general election, he defeated Republican nominee Hildegarde Rodriguez-Schieman 78%-22%.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=27840</ref>

;Re-elections (1994-2010)
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Illinois, 2010#District 4}}
In 1994 Gutierrez defeated Soliz in the primary by an even larger margin 64%-36%,<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=437690</ref> and won re-election to a second term in the general election with 75% of the vote, the lowest winning percentage in a general election in his career.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=28790</ref> From 1996 to 2008, Gutiérrez won re-election seven times, each time with more than 80% of the vote.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/CandidateDetail.html?CandidateID=1081</ref> In 2010, he won re-election to his tenth term with 77% of the vote.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=489027</ref>  During this period of time Congressman Gutierrez, an Illinois native, began honing his Puerto Rican accent to perfection.

===Tenure===
==== Party leadership and Caucus membership ====

In 2009 [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives]] [[Nancy Pelosi]] appointed Gutiérrez Chair of the [[Democratic Caucus of the United States House of Representatives|Democratic Caucus]] [[immigration reform|Immigration]] Task Force. He continues to serve as the Chair of the [[Congressional Hispanic Caucus]] Immigration Task Force. In these roles he has served as the Congress's "leading strategist and spokesperson on immigration issues."<ref name="house.gov"/>

====Constituent services====

[[File:Gutierrez and Rahm Citizenship Workshop.jpg|thumb|Chicago Mayor [[Rahm Emanuel]] assists a constituent apply for US citizenship at Congressman Luis V. Gutierrez's monthly citizenship workshop.

====Consumer rights====
{{Primary sources|section|date=June 2014}}
In February 2009, Gutiérrez introduced H.R. 1214, the "Payday Loan Reform Act of 2009," co-sponsored by other members of the House of Representatives, including members of the House leadership. H.R. 1214 would cap the [[annual percentage rate]] (APR) for [[payday loan]]s at 391 percent in the 23 states where it is now allowed to exceed 391 percent.<ref>[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=h111-1214 Text of H.R. 1214: Payday Loan Reform Act of 2009]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c111:H.R.1214: |title=Bill Text – 111th Congress (2009–2010) – THOMAS (Library of Congress) |publisher=Thomas.loc.gov |date=2009-02-26 |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:HR01214:@@@P |title=Bill Summary & Status – 111th Congress (2009–2010) – H.R.1214 – Cosponsors – THOMAS (Library of Congress) |publisher=Thomas.loc.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref>

Gutiérrez was also a principal backer of the Dodd-Frank bill that created the [[United States Consumer Financial Protection Bureau]].<ref name="house.gov" />

==== Immigration reform and immigrant rights ====

Gutiérrez has been called the "undisputed champion of immigration reform" and "Moses of the Latinos" due to his many years advocating for immigrant rights.<ref>{{cite web

In his continued efforts to reform immigration Gutiérrez has participated in two acts of non-violent civil disobedience outside of the White House.  The first took place on May 1, 2010, where, following a speech delivered to hundreds at Lafayette Park, Gutiérrez marched with protesters to the White House and refused to leave until Presidential action was taken on immigration reform or he was arrested.  Many of the protesters who joined Gutiérrez had signs that called for a Presidential moratorium on deportation and criticized recent anti-immigrant legislation passed in Arizona – [[Arizona SB 1070|SB 1070]].  Gutiérrez also joined the protesters in criticizing Arizona Governor [[Jan Brewer]]'s decision to sign the measure allowing racial profiling in the state-level enforcement of immigration laws.<ref name="news.blogs.cnn.com">{{cite news |url=http://news.blogs.cnn.com/2010/05/01/congressman-arrested-at-immigration-rally/ |title=Congressman arrested at immigration rally |accessdate=2010-05-01 |publisher=CNN |date=May 1, 2010}}</ref>

On July 26, 2011 in response to a record breaking one-million deportations under President Obama, and the President's continued refusal to stave deportations of DREAM Act eligible youth, Gutiérrez and eleven labor, faith, and civil rights leaders were arrested outside of the White House.  A crowd of 2,500 came to support Gutiérrez and the eleven other leaders. A day before the arrest President Obama sent a letter to Gutiérrez in which he stated that he would continue his administration's deportation policy.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rep-luis-gutierrez/why-i-got-arrested-for-pr_b_916130.html |title=Why I Got Arrested for Protesting Obama's Deportation Policy |first=Luis |last=Gutierrez |publisher=[[Huffington Post]] |date=2011-08-02 |accessdate=June 22, 2014}}</ref>

In 2009 and again in 2011 Gutiérrez went on a nationwide tour in support of comprehensive immigration reform and a moratorium on the deportation of families.  The tours have received widespread media attention and helped revive the nationwide discussion on immigration reform.  Gutiérrez was the main speaker at the historic March 21, 2010 [[March for America]] rally at the capitol mall attended by over 200,000 people.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.alternet.org/immigration/146119/200,000_march_for_immigration_reform_in_massive_d.c._rally | author=Rivlin, Douglas | publisher=Alternet}}</ref>

Gutiérrez was the first elected official to sponsor a version of the [[DREAM Act]] – legislation to allow undocumented youth brought to the United States as minors a pathway to citizenship – in 2001.<ref name="house.gov"/> In 2009 Gutiérrez introduced CIR-ASAP – Comprehensive Immigration Reform for America's Security and Prosperity Act – a bill to create a pathway to citizenship for non-criminal undocumented immigrants and improve border security.  The bill received over 100 co-sponsors and was endorsed by members of the business community and [[organized labor]] unions, including the [[AFL-CIO]],  [[United Food and Commercial Workers]] and the [[Service Employees International Union]].<ref>{{cite news| title=CIR ASAP Is the Bill America's Workforce Asked for and Deserves | author=Gutierrez, Luis |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rep-luis-gutierrez/cir-asap-is-the-bill-amer_b_396228.html | accessdate= July 8, 2011 | work=Huffington Post | date=2009-12-22}}</ref> He described the bill before a Washington DC rally: {{quote|My bill will promote fair immigration proceedings, humane treatment of immigration detainees, and policies that respect the tenet of community policing. No more raids in our community, no more separation of our families. Now, none of this works without a strong commitment to America’s labor force. None of it works without a strong commitment. So one of the tenets of our bill will be comprehensive immigration reform, has to mean—has to mean—to protecting all workers.|Luis Gutiérrez|<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2009/10/14/headlines

====Veterans' access to health care====
{{Self-published|section|date=June 2014}}
While he was a member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, the House passed legislation introduced by Gutiérrez that made treatment and counseling available to [[veterans]] that have been victims of [[Military sexual trauma|sexual trauma]].<ref name="house.gov"/> Gutiérrez also successfully expanded health care coverage to those exposed to [[Agent Orange]] and high levels of [[radiation]] during military service.<ref name="house.gov"/>

Gutiérrez's assistance was pivotal in securing $92 million in additional health care and [[prosthetic]] funding for veterans.<ref name="house.gov"/>

====Puerto Rico====

Gutiérrez has been an outspoken advocate for human and civil rights of the [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] people.  In the late 1990s and the 2000s he was a leader in the [[United States Navy in Vieques, Puerto Rico|Vieques movement]], which sought to stop the [[United States military]] from using the inhabited island as a bomb testing ground.  In May 2000 Gutiérrez was one of nearly two-hundred arrested for refusing to leave the natural habitat the US military wished to continue using as a bombing range.<ref name="Morales, Ed">{{cite news | url=http://www.thenation.com/article/battle-vieques | publisher=The Nation | title = The Battle of Vieques

In 2011 Gutiérrez came out against human rights abuses occurring on the island – specifically [[police brutality]] perpetrated against  [[University of Puerto Rico]] students critical of the island's government and a law passed by the [[Luis Fortuño|Fortuño]] government that sought to limit student's [[freedom of speech]]. Gutiérrez also spoke out against a proposed pipeline which would degrade the island's lush tropical habitat and potentially put residents living near the proposed pipeline in danger.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/massive-puerto-rico-pipeline-triggers-de | publisher=CNS News | title = Massive Puerto Rico pipeline triggers debate| author=Coto, Danica | date= May 14, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.gutierrez.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=662&Itemid=73 | publisher= Gutierrez Website | title=Shedding Light on Puerto Rico's Gasoducto Project}}</ref>

====Workers' rights====
Gutiérrez is a close ally of organized labor and has voted repeatedly to protect and expand [[labor rights|workers' rights]].  In 2008 Gutiérrez was one of the principal elected officials that assisted workers of the Chicago-based [[Republic Windows and Doors]] during their successful sit-in.  The workers had lost their jobs without advance notice, allegedly due to a refusal of credit from Bank of America after the bailout of the financial system.  He met with workers and helped them broker a deal with [[Bank of America]].<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Im7bCPXxWVU | title= Republic Windows Workers Occupy Factory}}.</ref> Gutiérrez views his advocacy for workers' rights and immigrant rights as invariably related. He is frequently invited to speak and present before labor unions.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.uaw.org/node/2998 | title=Gutierrez: Immigration issues tied to labor issues}}</ref>

In 1994 Gutiérrez was a vocal opponent of [[North American Free Trade Agreement|NAFTA]] and ultimately voted against the measure because of the legislation's failure to provide for worker retraining, protect against American job loss, and protect Mexican workers' [[collective bargaining]] rights.<ref>{{cite news | title=Gutierrez Resists Party Pressure, Vows He'll Vote Against Nafta | author= Holt, Douglas | publisher= Chicago Tribune | url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1993-11-15/news/9311150020_1_anti-nafta-forces-nafta-debate-undecided-house-members| date= November 13, 1993}}</ref>

====Public transportation====
{{Self-published|section|date=June 2014}}
When the [[Chicago Transit Authority]] (CTA) declared their plan to close down the [[Douglas Branch]] of the then [[Blue Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Blue Line]] – which primarily serves working-class Latino communities – Gutiérrez successfully secured $320 million in federal funding to reconstruct Blue Line stops and pressed the CTA to re-instate full service.<ref name="house.gov" /> The Douglas Branch is now known as the [[Pink Line (CTA)]].

====Use of civil disobedience====
With a background as a community activist and organizer Gutiérrez often uses non-violent [[civil disobedience]] when pushing political causes and legislation.  He was arrested in May 2000 in protest of the US military using the inhabited Puerto Rican island of Vieques as a bombing range, and again in May 2010 in protest of presidential inaction on immigration reform.<ref name="news.blogs.cnn.com"/><ref name="Morales, Ed"/>  In 2010 and 2011 he was arrested protesting presidential inaction on immigration reform and a record-breaking one-million deportations under President Obama. 

====Criticism====
{{criticism section|date=June 2014}}
Gutiérrez's progressive political stances make him a favorite target of [[right-wing politics|Right-wing]] political commentators. [[Michael Savage]] often attacks Gutiérrez and his political stances on the [[conservative talk radio]] program [[Savage Nation]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBjdX9SaSOI| title=Michael Savage EXPLODES over Illegal Immigration, Obama}}{{dead link|date=June 2014}}</ref>

Since 2008 Gutiérrez has been the subject of several critical stories in the [[Chicago Tribune]] and [[Chicago Sun-Times]], detailing his relationship with former Illinois Governor [[Rod Blagojevich]], and the real estate dealings of Gutierrez and his family.<ref>{{cite news |title=Records: Congressman put daughter up for her state job; CLOUT LIST Gutierrez denies going to Blago as hiring sponsor |first1=CHRIS |last1=FUSCO |first2=TIM |last2=NOVAK |url=http://www.suntimes.com/news/watchdogs/2226890,CST-NWS-watchside03.article |work=[http://www.suntimes.com/ Chicago Sun-Times] |date=2010-05-03 |accessdate=2010-05-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Congressman's daughter's sweet housing deal |first1=CHRIS |last1=FUSCO |first2=TIM |last2=NOVAK |url=http://www.suntimes.com/news/watchdogs/2226764,CST-NWS-watchdogs03.article |work=[http://www.suntimes.com/ Chicago Sun-Times] |date=2010-05-03 |accessdate=2010-05-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Rep.

===Committee assignments===
Upon arriving to the [[United States House of Representatives]] Gutiérrez attempted to organize the 63 incoming Democratic freshmen to support a reform agenda.  He sent each one a copy of the book ''Adventures in Porkland: How Washington Wastes Your Money and Why They Won't Stop''.  As a result of his attempts to organize the freshmen class Gutiérrez was passed up  by the [[floor leader|House leadership]] for his first choice of the [[United States House Committee on Ways and Means|Ways and Means Committee]] and his second choice of the [[United States House Committee on Education and the Workforce|Education Committee]]; instead he was assigned to the [[United States House Committee on Financial Services|Banking Committee]] and [[United States House Committee on Veterans' Affairs|Veterans' Affairs]].  In response to being bypassed for his top committee choices as result of his reform advocacy, Gutiérrez charged that then [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|House Speaker]] [[Tom Foley]] was "not a reformer in any sense."<ref>{{cite news |title= Congress Lacks Any Appetite For Reform, Gutierrez Charges |author= Kass, John |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1992-12-11/news/9204220888_1_alderman-reform-congress |newspaper= Chicago Tribune |date= December 11, 1992 |accessdate=July 7, 2011}}</ref>

Congressman Gutiérrez sits on the following House Committees:  

*'''[[United States House Committee on Financial Services|Committee on Financial Services]]'''
**[[United States House Financial Services Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit|Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit]]
**[[United States House Financial Services Subcommittee on Insurance, Housing and Community Opportunity|Subcommittee on Insurance, Housing and Community Opportunity]] (Ranking Member)
*'''[[United States House Committee on the Judiciary|Judiciary Committee]]'''
**[[United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration Policy and Border Security|Subcommittee on Immigration Policy and Border Security]]
**[[United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security and Investigations|Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security and Investigations]]
*'''[[United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence|Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence]]'''
**[[United States House Intelligence Subcommittee on Terrorism, HUMINT, Analysis and Counterintelligence|Subcommittee on Terrorism, HUMINT, Analysis and Counterintelligence]]

Gutiérrez was a member of the Judiciary Committee during the [[110th United States Congress|110th]] and [[111th United States Congress|111th]] Congress,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://maplight.org/us-congress/legislator/269-luis-gutirrez |title=Luis Gutiérrez Democrat (Elected 1992), IL House district 4|accessdate=July 8, 2011}}</ref> serving on the Immigration, Citizenship, Refugees, Border Security, and International Law Subcommittee.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.politico.com/arena/bio/rep_luis_gutierrez.html |title=Arena Profile: Rep. Luis Gutierrez|accessdate=July 8, 2011}}</ref>  During that same period of time he was the Chair of the Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit of the Financial Services Committee.<ref name="house.gov"/>

==Mayoral candidacy speculation==
Gutiérrez' name has often been mentioned as a potential candidate for [[Mayor of Chicago]].  In 2006 he explored running for mayor of Chicago against incumbent [[Richard M. Daley]], but announced in November that he would remain in Congress.

After Daley declared his retirement in 2011, Gutiérrez' name was once again floated as a potential mayoral candidate.  In an effort to draft the Congressman into the race students formed chapters of "Students for Luis Gutiérrez" at six colleges and two Chicago public high schools; but in October Gutiérrez removed his name from consideration stating: "I have an obligation not to give up on the fight I've already begun. I have unfinished business to complete," in reference to his work on immigration reform in the United States Congress.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.studentsforgutierrez.org/about | publisher= Students for Luis Gutierrez | title= About Us}}.</ref>

==Personal life==
Gutiérrez has been married to Soraida Arocho Gutiérrez for over thirty years.  Together they have two daughters – Omaira and Jessica.  Jessica's middle name – Washington – comes from the late Mayor [[Harold Washington]], a close friend and mentor of Gutiérrez.<ref name="articles.chicagotribune.com"/>  Soraida battled and survived cancer in the 2000s.<ref>{{cite news| last=Robinson |first=Kevin  |title=Gutierrez to Run Again, Everybody Loves Him |url=http://chicagoist.com/2007/08/17/gutierrez_to_ru.php|publisher=Chicagoist|accessdate=July 6, 2011}}</ref>

==Early life, education, and early career==
Gutiérrez was born and raised in the [[Lincoln Park, Chicago|Lincoln Park]] neighborhood of Chicago, then an immigrant and working class community.  His mother was an assembly-line worker and his father was a cab driver. After his freshman year at St. Michael's High School, his parents moved the family to their hometown of [[San Sebastián, Puerto Rico]]. Gutiérrez, who had never before visited the island, reluctantly followed his parents; there he learned to speak Spanish.  Gutiérrez said of his experience moving from Chicago to Puerto Rico: "In Lincoln Park, I had been called a spic, then all of a sudden I land on the island and everyone calls me ''gringo'' and ''Americanito''. I learned to speak Spanish well."<ref name="articles.chicagotribune.com"/>  

In 1974 Gutiérrez returned to Chicago and enrolled at [[Northeastern Illinois University]].  He got involved in student activism and [[social justice]] issues, writing for the student publication ''Que Ondee Sola'' and serving as the president of the Union for Puerto Rican Students.<ref>{{cite news|title=Candidates Go Heavy On Insults|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1986-04-26/news/8601300366_1_faln-puerto-rican-community-puerto-rico|publisher=''Chicago Tribune''|accessdate=July 5, 2011|author=Jack Houston|date=April 26, 1986}}</ref>  In 1976, while a senior at Northeastern, he began driving a cab in order to raise enough funds to visit his longtime girlfriend, Soraida, in Puerto Rico. In 1977, after graduating from Northeastern Illinois University with a degree in English he returned to Puerto Rico and married Soraida.  The couple returned to Chicago in 1978 and, unable to find other work,  Gutiérrez took up taxi driving full-time.<ref>{{cite news| title=Taking a Taxi to the House of Representatives| url=http://www.rollcall.com/issues/57_2/taking-a-taxi-to-the-house-of-representatives-207041-1.html?zkMobileView=false|date=2011-07-06|accessdate=2011-07-06|first=Alexandra|last=Jaffe|work= Roll Call}}</ref> Gutiérrez eventually found work as a [[Chicago Public School]] teacher and later a [[child abuse]] [[Caseworker (social work)|caseworker]] with the Illinois Department of Children & Family Services.<ref name="house.gov">{{cite web|title=Official Biography |url=http://gutierrez.house.gov/about-me/full-biography|publisher=house.gov|accessdate=June 22, 2013}}</ref>

==Early political career==

===Campaign for 32nd ward Democratic committeeman===
In 1983 Gutiérrez left his job with the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services to run against incumbent [[Dan Rostenkowski]] for 32nd ward Democratic committeeman in the March 1984 primary election.  To fund his campaign Gutiérrez returned to driving a cab seven days a week, 14 hours a day. Gutiérrez's work as a taxi driver grew his campaign fund to $6,000, against which Rostenkowski had hundreds of thousands of dollars.  Reporting on Gutiérrez's early political career, Jorge Casuso and Ben Joravsky of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' wrote: Gutiérrez thought he could win.  Washington's 1983 victory – the first local race Gutiérrez had voted in – had left him wildly optimistic.  Before that, he didn't think blacks, Hispanics and poor people could win a legitimate voice in local government."<ref name="articles.chicagotribune.com"/> 

Relying on his family and friends as campaign staff, Gutiérrez opened up his campaign office on North California Ave in Chicago's [[Humboldt Park, Chicago|Humboldt Park neighborhood]].  Gutiérrez collected over three-fourths of the 2,200 signatures he needed to quality for the ballot on his own.  Rostenkowski, then a twelve-term Congressman and Chair of the powerful [[United States House Committee on Ways and Means|House Ways & Means Committee]] soundly defeated Gutiérrez, with 76% of the vote.<ref name="articles.chicagotribune.com"/>

===Adviser to Harold Washington===
Following Gutiérrez's loss to Dan Rostenkowski he helped found the [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]] Coalition for New Politics in spring of 1984.  The coalition was meant to be a grassroots, independent, and multiracial counterweight to the [[Cook County Democratic Party]].<ref name="Marable 1998">{{cite book |last= Marable |first=Manning |title=Black leadership |publisher=[[Columbia University Press]] |year=1998 }}</ref>

Gutiérrez's political activism and role as a rising leader in Chicago's burgeoning Latino community caught the attention of Chicago's first African-American Mayor – Harold Washington – who appointed him in August 1984 to the position of deputy superintendent in the [[Law and Government of Chicago|Department of Streets and Sanitation]].<ref name="articles.chicagotribune.com"/>  

Gutiérrez served as a deputy superintendent in the Washington administration and as an administrative assistant to the Mayor – serving on the Mayor's committee on infrastructure.<ref name="Fremon 1988">{{cite book |last=Fremon |first=David |title=Chicago politics, ward by ward |publisher=[[Indiana University Press]] |year=1988 }}</ref>  

In October 1984 a [[Molotov cocktail]] came crashing through the front living room window of Gutiérrez's home.  For a period of three months following the firebombing his family lived in hotel rooms.  The offenders were never identified, but Gutiérrez attributed the attack to "culprits from the right... opposed to reform and Mayor Washington."<ref name="articles.chicagotribune.com"/>  

In July 1985, in an effort to support Washington's political reform movement, Gutiérrez founded the [[West Town, Chicago|West Town]]-26th Ward Independent Political Organization (IPO).  Like the Cook County Coalition for New Politics, the organization aimed to bring together residents of all races in support of progressive reform in Chicago. The Mayor attended the organization's kick-off event, at which 100 names were added to the mailing list and $5,000 was raised.<ref name="articles.chicagotribune.com"/>

===1986 Aldermanic election===
[[File:Luis Gutierrez and Mayor Harold Washington.jpg|thumb|Mayor [[Harold Washington]] was a key backer of Gutierrez's 1986 bid for 26th ward alderman.]]
In December 1985, as a result of a November 1985 ward remap, district court judge [[Charles Ronald Norgle, Sr.|Charles Norgle]] ordered a special election for March 18, 1986 in seven wards, including the 26th.<ref name="Fremon 1988"/> The incumbent alderman of the 26th ward, Michael Nardulli, an Italian-American, chose not to seek re-election in the newly drawn majority Latino district.  Gutiérrez declared his candidacy for alderman of the 26th ward and soon received the endorsement of Mayor Harold Washington.  At the time of the election opponents to Washington's administration, led by [[Edward Vrdolyak|Ed Vrdolyak]] of the 10th ward, controlled the City Council.  This divide within city government was dubbed by the Chicago media as [[Council Wars]].  The 1986 special elections gave Washington the opportunity to take control of the city council.  Because the six other special elections were all but decided, control of the council came down to the race in the 26th ward.  [[Manuel Torres]], then a member of the Democratic machine and Cook County Commissioner also entered the race for 26th ward Alderman.  Torres was endorsed by Vrdolyak, former mayor [[Jane Byrne]], future mayor and then State's Attorney [[Richard M. Daley]], and machine Alderman [[Edward M. Burke|Ed Burke]] and [[Richard Mell|Dick Mell]].<ref name="Fremon 1988"/>  

Gutiérrez's campaign volunteers were primarily women,"ex-hippies and... community activists-black, white and Hispanic."<ref name="articles.chicagotribune.com"/>  With the campaign theme: "Church, Family, Community," support from Mayor Harold Washington – who donated $12,000 to Gutiérrez – and the now 250 members of the West Town-26th Ward Independent Political Organization as volunteers, Gutiérrez bested Torres by 22 votes, a margin not large enough to avoid a run-off against Torres.<ref name="Marable 1998"/><ref>{{cite news|publisher=The Chicago Tribune|author=Gibson, Ray|title=Mayor Helped Fund Candidates| date=1986-04-16}}</ref>

On the eve of the Gutiérrez-Torres run-off Spanish language television aired the candidates' final debate.  Gutiérrez, who spoke Spanish during the debate, outperformed Torres, who chose to speak entirely in English. Gutiérrez's use of Spanish and his grassroots organizing are credited for his 53%–47% victory over Torres.  Gutiérrez is reported to have said during the election: "My supporters could give a damn about the Democratic Party.  They're ready to work on whatever it is that moves socioeconomic justice ahead."<ref name="Marable 1998"/><ref name="Fremon 1988"/>

===Chicago City Council===
Upon entering the [[Chicago City Council]] Gutiérrez, representing the 26th Ward, became Mayor Harold Washington's unofficial floor leader and leader of the Latinos in the council.<ref name="Fremon 1988"/>   Gutiérrez said of his role as unofficial Washington spokesman: "There are only six or seven of us of the twenty-five [pro-Washington alderman] that say anything.  You could say there's only six or seven that have big mouths and want to talk all the time.  But I figured it out-there's only six or seven of us that Eddie Vrdolyak doesn't have anything on,  that Eddie Vrdolyak hasn't done a favor for, that Eddie Vrdolyak hasn't taken care of some problem,  that Eddie Vrdolyak doesn't have some dirt on.  So when you want to get up and take Eddie on, you got to be clean."<ref name="Fremon 1988"/>

As a member of the city council Gutiérrez was a key backer of the 1986 gay rights ordinance – which sought to ban discrimination based upon gender & sexual orientation.   He was also a proponent of local economic development and construction of affordable housing.  He was referred to as a "workhorse in the city council" by political author Marable Manning.<ref name="Fremon 1988"/>  

In the 1987 municipal elections Gutiérrez faced five opponents and be re-elected to the City Council with 66% of the vote.<ref name="Fremon 1988"/> Following Washington's death and the battle over who would succeed the deceased Mayor, Gutiérrez voted for African-American Alderman [[Timothy C. Evans]] over machine-backed Alderman [[Eugene Sawyer]].  In the 1989 Mayoral election Gutiérrez endorsed State's Attorney [[Richard M. Daley]] for Mayor, stating: "I will have a great influence in determining the thrust and tone of the Daley administration`s progressive and liberal agendas."<ref>{{cite news|publisher=The Chicago Tribune|author=Casuso, Jorge|title=Gutierrez`s Turnabout Has Heads Spinning|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1989-02-13/news/8903040994_1_gutierrez-alderman-timothy-evans|date=1989-02-13}}</ref>

Under Daley's administration Gutiérrez served as Chair of the Committee on Housing, Land Acquisition, Disposition and Leases and Council President [[pro tempore]], presiding over meetings in the Mayor's absence.<ref name="articles.chicagotribune.com"/>

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
;Election (1992)
In 1990 a court order created a new "[[earmuff|earmuff-shaped]]" majority Latino congressional district, with two main sections in Chicago connected by a thin corridor in the suburbs.  Four candidates announced their intention to run in the 1992 Democratic primary – Gutiérrez, Alderman [[Richard Mell|Dick Mell]] of the 33rd ward, then Cook County Board of Appeals Commissioner [[Joseph Berrios]], and [[Juan Soliz]], former Alderman of 25th ward.<ref name="Kass, John">{{cite news |author= Kass, John |date=1991-12-10 |title=Gutierrez Picks Up Daley`s Backing For Congress |work=Chicago Tribune |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1991-12-10/news/9104210061_1_alderman-mayor-richard-daley-hispanic }}</ref>  Mell, the only white candidate entered the race out of his "personal dislike for Gutiérrez." <ref name="Davis, Robert">{{cite news |author= Davis, Robert |date=1991-12-18 |title=Hispanics Urge Mell To Withdraw, But Soliz Disagrees |work=Chicago Tribune |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1991-12-18/news/9104230484_1_hispanic-leaders-richard-mell-alderman}}</ref> Gutiérrez received the endorsement of Mayor Richard M.

;Re-elections (1994-2010)
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Illinois, 2010#District 4}}
In 1994 Gutierrez defeated Soliz in the primary by an even larger margin 64%-36%,<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=437690</ref> and won re-election to a second term in the general election with 75% of the vote, the lowest winning percentage in a general election in his career.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=28790</ref> From 1996 to 2008, Gutiérrez won re-election seven times, each time with more than 80% of the vote.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/CandidateDetail.html?CandidateID=1081</ref> In 2010, he won re-election to his tenth term with 77% of the vote.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=489027</ref>  During this period of time Congressman Gutierrez, an Illinois native, began honing his Puerto Rican accent to perfection.

===Tenure===
==== Party leadership and Caucus membership ====

In 2009 [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives]] [[Nancy Pelosi]] appointed Gutiérrez Chair of the [[Democratic Caucus of the United States House of Representatives|Democratic Caucus]] [[immigration reform|Immigration]] Task Force. He continues to serve as the Chair of the [[Congressional Hispanic Caucus]] Immigration Task Force. In these roles he has served as the Congress's "leading strategist and spokesperson on immigration issues."<ref name="house.gov"/>

====Constituent services====

[[File:Gutierrez and Rahm Citizenship Workshop.jpg|thumb|Chicago Mayor [[Rahm Emanuel]] assists a constituent apply for US citizenship at Congressman Luis V. Gutierrez's monthly citizenship workshop.

====Consumer rights====
{{Primary sources|section|date=June 2014}}
In February 2009, Gutiérrez introduced H.R. 1214, the "Payday Loan Reform Act of 2009," co-sponsored by other members of the House of Representatives, including members of the House leadership. H.R. 1214 would cap the [[annual percentage rate]] (APR) for [[payday loan]]s at 391 percent in the 23 states where it is now allowed to exceed 391 percent.<ref>[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=h111-1214 Text of H.R. 1214: Payday Loan Reform Act of 2009]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c111:H.R.1214: |title=Bill Text – 111th Congress (2009–2010) – THOMAS (Library of Congress) |publisher=Thomas.loc.gov |date=2009-02-26 |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:HR01214:@@@P |title=Bill Summary & Status – 111th Congress (2009–2010) – H.R.1214 – Cosponsors – THOMAS (Library of Congress) |publisher=Thomas.loc.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref>

Gutiérrez was also a principal backer of the Dodd-Frank bill that created the [[United States Consumer Financial Protection Bureau]].<ref name="house.gov" />

==== Immigration reform and immigrant rights ====

Gutiérrez has been called the "undisputed champion of immigration reform" and "Moses of the Latinos" due to his many years advocating for immigrant rights.<ref>{{cite web

In his continued efforts to reform immigration Gutiérrez has participated in two acts of non-violent civil disobedience outside of the White House.  The first took place on May 1, 2010, where, following a speech delivered to hundreds at Lafayette Park, Gutiérrez marched with protesters to the White House and refused to leave until Presidential action was taken on immigration reform or he was arrested.  Many of the protesters who joined Gutiérrez had signs that called for a Presidential moratorium on deportation and criticized recent anti-immigrant legislation passed in Arizona – [[Arizona SB 1070|SB 1070]].  Gutiérrez also joined the protesters in criticizing Arizona Governor [[Jan Brewer]]'s decision to sign the measure allowing racial profiling in the state-level enforcement of immigration laws.<ref name="news.blogs.cnn.com">{{cite news |url=http://news.blogs.cnn.com/2010/05/01/congressman-arrested-at-immigration-rally/ |title=Congressman arrested at immigration rally |accessdate=2010-05-01 |publisher=CNN |date=May 1, 2010}}</ref>

On July 26, 2011 in response to a record breaking one-million deportations under President Obama, and the President's continued refusal to stave deportations of DREAM Act eligible youth, Gutiérrez and eleven labor, faith, and civil rights leaders were arrested outside of the White House.  A crowd of 2,500 came to support Gutiérrez and the eleven other leaders. A day before the arrest President Obama sent a letter to Gutiérrez in which he stated that he would continue his administration's deportation policy.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rep-luis-gutierrez/why-i-got-arrested-for-pr_b_916130.html |title=Why I Got Arrested for Protesting Obama's Deportation Policy |first=Luis |last=Gutierrez |publisher=[[Huffington Post]] |date=2011-08-02 |accessdate=June 22, 2014}}</ref>

In 2009 and again in 2011 Gutiérrez went on a nationwide tour in support of comprehensive immigration reform and a moratorium on the deportation of families.  The tours have received widespread media attention and helped revive the nationwide discussion on immigration reform.  Gutiérrez was the main speaker at the historic March 21, 2010 [[March for America]] rally at the capitol mall attended by over 200,000 people.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.alternet.org/immigration/146119/200,000_march_for_immigration_reform_in_massive_d.c._rally | author=Rivlin, Douglas | publisher=Alternet}}</ref>

Gutiérrez was the first elected official to sponsor a version of the [[DREAM Act]] – legislation to allow undocumented youth brought to the United States as minors a pathway to citizenship – in 2001.<ref name="house.gov"/> In 2009 Gutiérrez introduced CIR-ASAP – Comprehensive Immigration Reform for America's Security and Prosperity Act – a bill to create a pathway to citizenship for non-criminal undocumented immigrants and improve border security.  The bill received over 100 co-sponsors and was endorsed by members of the business community and [[organized labor]] unions, including the [[AFL-CIO]],  [[United Food and Commercial Workers]] and the [[Service Employees International Union]].<ref>{{cite news| title=CIR ASAP Is the Bill America's Workforce Asked for and Deserves | author=Gutierrez, Luis |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rep-luis-gutierrez/cir-asap-is-the-bill-amer_b_396228.html | accessdate= July 8, 2011 | work=Huffington Post | date=2009-12-22}}</ref> He described the bill before a Washington DC rally: {{quote|My bill will promote fair immigration proceedings, humane treatment of immigration detainees, and policies that respect the tenet of community policing. No more raids in our community, no more separation of our families. Now, none of this works without a strong commitment to America’s labor force. None of it works without a strong commitment. So one of the tenets of our bill will be comprehensive immigration reform, has to mean—has to mean—to protecting all workers.|Luis Gutiérrez|<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2009/10/14/headlines

====Veterans' access to health care====
{{Self-published|section|date=June 2014}}
While he was a member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, the House passed legislation introduced by Gutiérrez that made treatment and counseling available to [[veterans]] that have been victims of [[Military sexual trauma|sexual trauma]].<ref name="house.gov"/> Gutiérrez also successfully expanded health care coverage to those exposed to [[Agent Orange]] and high levels of [[radiation]] during military service.<ref name="house.gov"/>

Gutiérrez's assistance was pivotal in securing $92 million in additional health care and [[prosthetic]] funding for veterans.<ref name="house.gov"/>

====Puerto Rico====

Gutiérrez has been an outspoken advocate for human and civil rights of the [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] people.  In the late 1990s and the 2000s he was a leader in the [[United States Navy in Vieques, Puerto Rico|Vieques movement]], which sought to stop the [[United States military]] from using the inhabited island as a bomb testing ground.  In May 2000 Gutiérrez was one of nearly two-hundred arrested for refusing to leave the natural habitat the US military wished to continue using as a bombing range.<ref name="Morales, Ed">{{cite news | url=http://www.thenation.com/article/battle-vieques | publisher=The Nation | title = The Battle of Vieques
 | author=Morales, Ed | date= May 11, 2000}}</ref>   

In 2011 Gutiérrez came out against human rights abuses occurring on the island – specifically [[police brutality]] perpetrated against  [[University of Puerto Rico]] students critical of the island's government and a law passed by the [[Luis Fortuño|Fortuño]] government that sought to limit student's [[freedom of speech]]. Gutiérrez also spoke out against a proposed pipeline which would degrade the island's lush tropical habitat and potentially put residents living near the proposed pipeline in danger.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/massive-puerto-rico-pipeline-triggers-de | publisher=CNS News | title = Massive Puerto Rico pipeline triggers debate| author=Coto, Danica | date= May 14, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.gutierrez.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=662&Itemid=73 | publisher= Gutierrez Website | title=Shedding Light on Puerto Rico's Gasoducto Project}}</ref>

====Workers' rights====
Gutiérrez is a close ally of organized labor and has voted repeatedly to protect and expand [[labor rights|workers' rights]].  In 2008 Gutiérrez was one of the principal elected officials that assisted workers of the Chicago-based [[Republic Windows and Doors]] during their successful sit-in.  The workers had lost their jobs without advance notice, allegedly due to a refusal of credit from Bank of America after the bailout of the financial system.  He met with workers and helped them broker a deal with [[Bank of America]].<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Im7bCPXxWVU | title= Republic Windows Workers Occupy Factory}}.</ref> Gutiérrez views his advocacy for workers' rights and immigrant rights as invariably related. He is frequently invited to speak and present before labor unions.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.uaw.org/node/2998 | title=Gutierrez: Immigration issues tied to labor issues}}</ref>

In 1994 Gutiérrez was a vocal opponent of [[North American Free Trade Agreement|NAFTA]] and ultimately voted against the measure because of the legislation's failure to provide for worker retraining, protect against American job loss, and protect Mexican workers' [[collective bargaining]] rights.<ref>{{cite news | title=Gutierrez Resists Party Pressure, Vows He'll Vote Against Nafta | author= Holt, Douglas | publisher= Chicago Tribune | url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1993-11-15/news/9311150020_1_anti-nafta-forces-nafta-debate-undecided-house-members| date= November 13, 1993}}</ref>

====Public transportation====
{{Self-published|section|date=June 2014}}
When the [[Chicago Transit Authority]] (CTA) declared their plan to close down the [[Douglas Branch]] of the then [[Blue Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Blue Line]] – which primarily serves working-class Latino communities – Gutiérrez successfully secured $320 million in federal funding to reconstruct Blue Line stops and pressed the CTA to re-instate full service.<ref name="house.gov" /> The Douglas Branch is now known as the [[Pink Line (CTA)]].

====Use of civil disobedience====
With a background as a community activist and organizer Gutiérrez often uses non-violent [[civil disobedience]] when pushing political causes and legislation.  He was arrested in May 2000 in protest of the US military using the inhabited Puerto Rican island of Vieques as a bombing range, and again in May 2010 in protest of presidential inaction on immigration reform.<ref name="news.blogs.cnn.com"/><ref name="Morales, Ed"/>  In 2010 and 2011 he was arrested protesting presidential inaction on immigration reform and a record-breaking one-million deportations under President Obama. 

====Criticism====
{{criticism section|date=June 2014}}
Gutiérrez's progressive political stances make him a favorite target of [[right-wing politics|Right-wing]] political commentators. [[Michael Savage]] often attacks Gutiérrez and his political stances on the [[conservative talk radio]] program [[Savage Nation]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBjdX9SaSOI| title=Michael Savage EXPLODES over Illegal Immigration, Obama}}{{dead link|date=June 2014}}</ref>

Since 2008 Gutiérrez has been the subject of several critical stories in the [[Chicago Tribune]] and [[Chicago Sun-Times]], detailing his relationship with former Illinois Governor [[Rod Blagojevich]], and the real estate dealings of Gutierrez and his family.<ref>{{cite news |title=Records: Congressman put daughter up for her state job; CLOUT LIST Gutierrez denies going to Blago as hiring sponsor |first1=CHRIS |last1=FUSCO |first2=TIM |last2=NOVAK |url=http://www.suntimes.com/news/watchdogs/2226890,CST-NWS-watchside03.article |work=[http://www.suntimes.com/ Chicago Sun-Times] |date=2010-05-03 |accessdate=2010-05-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Congressman's daughter's sweet housing deal |first1=CHRIS |last1=FUSCO |first2=TIM |last2=NOVAK |url=http://www.suntimes.com/news/watchdogs/2226764,CST-NWS-watchdogs03.article |work=[http://www.suntimes.com/ Chicago Sun-Times] |date=2010-05-03 |accessdate=2010-05-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Rep.

===Committee assignments===
Upon arriving to the [[United States House of Representatives]] Gutiérrez attempted to organize the 63 incoming Democratic freshmen to support a reform agenda.  He sent each one a copy of the book ''Adventures in Porkland: How Washington Wastes Your Money and Why They Won't Stop''.  As a result of his attempts to organize the freshmen class Gutiérrez was passed up  by the [[floor leader|House leadership]] for his first choice of the [[United States House Committee on Ways and Means|Ways and Means Committee]] and his second choice of the [[United States House Committee on Education and the Workforce|Education Committee]]; instead he was assigned to the [[United States House Committee on Financial Services|Banking Committee]] and [[United States House Committee on Veterans' Affairs|Veterans' Affairs]].  In response to being bypassed for his top committee choices as result of his reform advocacy, Gutiérrez charged that then [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|House Speaker]] [[Tom Foley]] was "not a reformer in any sense."<ref>{{cite news |title= Congress Lacks Any Appetite For Reform, Gutierrez Charges |author= Kass, John |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1992-12-11/news/9204220888_1_alderman-reform-congress |newspaper= Chicago Tribune |date= December 11, 1992 |accessdate=July 7, 2011}}</ref>

Congressman Gutiérrez sits on the following House Committees:  

*'''[[United States House Committee on Financial Services|Committee on Financial Services]]'''
**[[United States House Financial Services Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit|Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit]]
**[[United States House Financial Services Subcommittee on Insurance, Housing and Community Opportunity|Subcommittee on Insurance, Housing and Community Opportunity]] (Ranking Member)
*'''[[United States House Committee on the Judiciary|Judiciary Committee]]'''
**[[United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration Policy and Border Security|Subcommittee on Immigration Policy and Border Security]]
**[[United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security and Investigations|Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security and Investigations]]
*'''[[United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence|Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence]]'''
**[[United States House Intelligence Subcommittee on Terrorism, HUMINT, Analysis and Counterintelligence|Subcommittee on Terrorism, HUMINT, Analysis and Counterintelligence]]

Gutiérrez was a member of the Judiciary Committee during the [[110th United States Congress|110th]] and [[111th United States Congress|111th]] Congress,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://maplight.org/us-congress/legislator/269-luis-gutirrez |title=Luis Gutiérrez Democrat (Elected 1992), IL House district 4|accessdate=July 8, 2011}}</ref> serving on the Immigration, Citizenship, Refugees, Border Security, and International Law Subcommittee.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.politico.com/arena/bio/rep_luis_gutierrez.html |title=Arena Profile: Rep. Luis Gutierrez|accessdate=July 8, 2011}}</ref>  During that same period of time he was the Chair of the Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit of the Financial Services Committee.<ref name="house.gov"/>

==Mayoral candidacy speculation==
Gutiérrez' name has often been mentioned as a potential candidate for [[Mayor of Chicago]].  In 2006 he explored running for mayor of Chicago against incumbent [[Richard M. Daley]], but announced in November that he would remain in Congress.

After Daley declared his retirement in 2011, Gutiérrez' name was once again floated as a potential mayoral candidate.  In an effort to draft the Congressman into the race students formed chapters of "Students for Luis Gutiérrez" at six colleges and two Chicago public high schools; but in October Gutiérrez removed his name from consideration stating: "I have an obligation not to give up on the fight I've already begun. I have unfinished business to complete," in reference to his work on immigration reform in the United States Congress.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.studentsforgutierrez.org/about | publisher= Students for Luis Gutierrez | title= About Us}}.</ref>

==Personal life==
Gutiérrez has been married to Soraida Arocho Gutiérrez for over thirty years.  Together they have two daughters – Omaira and Jessica.  Jessica's middle name – Washington – comes from the late Mayor [[Harold Washington]], a close friend and mentor of Gutiérrez.<ref name="articles.chicagotribune.com"/>  Soraida battled and survived cancer in the 2000s.<ref>{{cite news| last=Robinson |first=Kevin  |title=Gutierrez to Run Again, Everybody Loves Him |url=http://chicagoist.com/2007/08/17/gutierrez_to_ru.php|publisher=Chicagoist|accessdate=July 6, 2011}}</ref>
