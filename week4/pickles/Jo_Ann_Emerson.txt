'''Jo Ann Emerson''' (born September 16, 1950) is an [[United States|American]] politician who was the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|MO|8|}} from 1996 to 2013. The district consists of Southeast and South Central Missouri and includes the [[Missouri Bootheel|Bootheel]], the [[Lead Belt]] and the [[Ozarks]]. Emerson is a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. On January 22, 2013, Emerson resigned her seat in Congress to become the President and Chief Executive Officer of the [[National Rural Electric Cooperative Association]].

With the defeat of Congressman [[Ike Skelton]], Emerson became the dean, ''i.e.'', the longest-serving member, of [[United States congressional delegations from Missouri|Missouri's congressional delegation]] in 2011.

==Early life, education and career==
She was born Jo Ann Hermann in [[Bethesda, Maryland]]. She was a daughter of Albert "A.B." Hermann, who played for the [[History of the Boston Braves|Boston Braves]] baseball team from 1923–1924 and was executive director of the Republican National Committee.<ref name="SSD100912">{{cite news

They had two daughters; Jo Ann also has five stepdaughters and a stepson. Bill was elected to the U.S. Congress in 1980 from Missouri's 10th Congressional District and, subsequent to redistricting, was reelected in 1982 from the 8th District. He died from [[cancer]] on June 22, 1996, a few months before the end of his eighth term. The [[Bill Emerson Memorial Bridge]], which links [[Missouri]] to [[Illinois]] across the [[Mississippi River]], was dedicated to commemorate his efforts to obtain [[Earmark (finance)|federal funding]] for its construction.

Following Bill's death, Jo Ann married Ron Gladney in 2000. From this marriage she gained a stepdaughter and a stepson.

Emerson, whose voting record in Congress has established her as one of the more moderate Republicans, has a history of bipartisanship while in the U.S. House of Representatives. She is a member of the moderate Republican groups the [[Republican Main Street Partnership]] and [[The Tuesday Group (of moderate Republican congressmen)|The Tuesday Group]].

On May 24, 2005, Emerson was one of 50 Republicans to vote in favor of overturning President [[George W. Bush]]'s ban on federal funding for [[Embryonic stem cells|embryonic stem cell]] research. She cast her "yea" vote the day after her mother-in-law died from [[Alzheimer's Disease]], one of the illnesses for which scientists believe they can create better treatments from stem cell research.

On July 12, 2007, Emerson was one of only four Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives who voted to withdraw U.S. troops from Iraq by April 2008.<ref>http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2007/roll624.xml</ref>

On September 15, 2009, Emerson was one of seven House Republicans to vote in favor of the Democrats' proposed resolution to condemn [[U.S. Representative]] [[Joe Wilson (U.S. politician)|Joe Wilson]] (R-[[South Carolina]]) for shouting "You lie!" in the middle of [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]]'s joint address to the U.S. Congress on health care reform.

Her margins of victory in the district have always been higher than those of GOP presidential candidates [[George W. Bush]] and [[John McCain]] as well as Republican gubernatorial candidates [[Kenny Hulshof]], [[Matt Blunt]] and [[Jim Talent]].

Emerson announced in early December 2012 her plans to retire from Congress in February 2013 to assume a position with the [[National Rural Electric Cooperative Association]] as its president and [[Chief Executive Officer]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Jo Ann Emerson to retire in Feb.|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2012/12/jo-ann-emerson-retiring-84508.html?hp=bn|accessdate=3 December 2012|newspaper=Politico|date=3 December 2012}}</ref>

==Political campaigns==
When her husband Bill died in 1996, Jo Ann announced she would run for his vacant seat.  However, Missouri state law prohibited her from filing in the [[U.S. Republican Party|Republican]] [[primary election|primary]] for the general election. In November, Jo Ann Emerson competed in two elections on the same day. She ran as a Republican against Democrat Emily Firebaugh in the special election to finish the last two months of her late husband's final term, and as an [[independent (politician)|independent]] against Democrat Firebaugh and Republican Richard Kline in the general election for a full two-year term. She won both elections easily and has been reelected seven times without serious difficulty. She is the first Republican woman elected to the U.S. Congress from Missouri. She served the last two months of her husband's term as an independent caucusing with the Republicans before officially becoming a Republican at the start of the new Congress in 1997. She was briefly the first independent elected to federal office in Missouri in 122 years.<ref>{{Cite book
