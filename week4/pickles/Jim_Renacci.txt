Renacci defeated Sutton by a 52% to 48% margin on Election Day.

===Tenure===
In May 2012, a Renacci campaign contributor was the subject of a [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] probe into $100,000 of campaign contributions made by employees of an Ohio-based direct marketing corporation, Suarez Corporation Industries, to Renacci's campaign. Many of the non-executive employees had never donated to a campaign before and owned modest homes, yet were reported as donating the maximum legal amount of $5,000 to Renacci. The investigation was sparked by prior ''[[Toledo Blade]]'' reports of the alleged violations of federal campaign finance law prohibiting a donor from contributing in another's name and prohibiting a corporation from using bonuses or other methods of reimbursing employees for their contributions. Renacci’s campaign returned all of the donations.<ref>{{cite news | first = Tony | last = Cook | title = Campaign donations prompt FBI probe | date = May 21, 2012 | url = http://www.toledoblade.com/Politics/2012/05/21/U-S-Attorney-General-s-Office-investigating-campaign-contributions-to-Ohio-Treasurer-Josh-Mandel-U-S-Rep-Jim-Renacci.html | work = [[Toledo Blade]] | accessdate = June 23, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | first = Alec | last = MacGillis | title = The Battleground | date = May 18, 2012 | url = http://www.tnr.com/article/politics/magazine/103409/ohio-battleground-state-election-2012-labor-union-sb5-sherrod-brown-john-kasich | work = [[The New Republic]] | accessdate = June 23, 2012}}</ref>

===Tenure===
In May 2012, a Renacci campaign contributor was the subject of a [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] probe into $100,000 of campaign contributions made by employees of an Ohio-based direct marketing corporation, Suarez Corporation Industries, to Renacci's campaign. Many of the non-executive employees had never donated to a campaign before and owned modest homes, yet were reported as donating the maximum legal amount of $5,000 to Renacci. The investigation was sparked by prior ''[[Toledo Blade]]'' reports of the alleged violations of federal campaign finance law prohibiting a donor from contributing in another's name and prohibiting a corporation from using bonuses or other methods of reimbursing employees for their contributions. Renacci’s campaign returned all of the donations.<ref>{{cite news | first = Tony | last = Cook | title = Campaign donations prompt FBI probe | date = May 21, 2012 | url = http://www.toledoblade.com/Politics/2012/05/21/U-S-Attorney-General-s-Office-investigating-campaign-contributions-to-Ohio-Treasurer-Josh-Mandel-U-S-Rep-Jim-Renacci.html | work = [[Toledo Blade]] | accessdate = June 23, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | first = Alec | last = MacGillis | title = The Battleground | date = May 18, 2012 | url = http://www.tnr.com/article/politics/magazine/103409/ohio-battleground-state-election-2012-labor-union-sb5-sherrod-brown-john-kasich | work = [[The New Republic]] | accessdate = June 23, 2012}}</ref>

===Tenure===
In May 2012, a Renacci campaign contributor was the subject of a [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] probe into $100,000 of campaign contributions made by employees of an Ohio-based direct marketing corporation, Suarez Corporation Industries, to Renacci's campaign. Many of the non-executive employees had never donated to a campaign before and owned modest homes, yet were reported as donating the maximum legal amount of $5,000 to Renacci. The investigation was sparked by prior ''[[Toledo Blade]]'' reports of the alleged violations of federal campaign finance law prohibiting a donor from contributing in another's name and prohibiting a corporation from using bonuses or other methods of reimbursing employees for their contributions. Renacci’s campaign returned all of the donations.<ref>{{cite news | first = Tony | last = Cook | title = Campaign donations prompt FBI probe | date = May 21, 2012 | url = http://www.toledoblade.com/Politics/2012/05/21/U-S-Attorney-General-s-Office-investigating-campaign-contributions-to-Ohio-Treasurer-Josh-Mandel-U-S-Rep-Jim-Renacci.html | work = [[Toledo Blade]] | accessdate = June 23, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | first = Alec | last = MacGillis | title = The Battleground | date = May 18, 2012 | url = http://www.tnr.com/article/politics/magazine/103409/ohio-battleground-state-election-2012-labor-union-sb5-sherrod-brown-john-kasich | work = [[The New Republic]] | accessdate = June 23, 2012}}</ref>
