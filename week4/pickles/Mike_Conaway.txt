===Tenure===
In 2006, Conaway voted against extending the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]].<ref>https://votesmart.org/candidate/key-votes/49935/mike-conaway/13/civil-liberties-and-civil-rights</ref><ref>http://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/state-politics/20131224-aides-to-texans-on-capitol-hill-alter-bosses-wikipedia-entries.ece</ref>

==Party leadership==
In January 2007, Conaway began chairing the three-member audit committee for the [[National Republican Congressional Committee]]. By January 28, 2008, Conaway had uncovered a fraud, where hundreds of thousands of dollars were missing from NRCC bank accounts, and supposed annual audits on the NRCC books had actually not been performed since 2001.<ref>[http://archive.is/XAMdr  Suzanne Gamboa, "Texas lawmaker uncovers GOP committee fraud", Associated Press, published by the ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'' (March 13, 2008).]</ref>

Conaway is one of the few [[Certified Public Accountant]]s in Congress.

===Farm subsidies===
From 2003 through 2005, $14.7 billion in crop subsidies went to the congressional districts of members on the House Committee on Agriculture, an analysis by the non-partisan Environmental Working Group found. That was 42.4% of the total subsidies. Conaway is reported to have brought $322 million to his district.<ref>Dilanian, Ken, [http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2007-07-25-farmbill_N.htm#subsidies " Billions go to House panel members' districts"], USA Today. July 26, 2007.</ref>

==Political campaigns==
Conaway first ran for elective office in 2003, when he ran in a special election for the 19th Congressional District, which came open after 18-year Republican incumbent [[Larry Combest]] stepped down shortly after winning a 10th term. Conaway lost by 587 votes to fellow Republican [[Randy Neugebauer]]. A few months later, the [[Texas Legislature]] [[2003 Texas redistricting|redrew the state's districts]] in an effort engineered by then-[[House Majority Leader]] [[Tom DeLay]]. Three brand-new districts were created, one of them being the 11th, which was based in Midland. Previously, Midland had been part of the [[Lubbock, Texas|Lubbock]]-based 19th District. DeLay was particularly keen to draw a district based in Midland, Odessa and the oil-rich [[Permian Basin (North America)|Permian Basin]] in part because [[Texas House]] Speaker [[Tom Craddick]] was from that area. This district is heavily Republican&nbsp;— by some accounts, the most Republican district in Texas.  Republican candidates usually garner 70 percent or more of the vote in this area ([[Glasscock County]] had voted 93.1 percent for Bush in 2000, the highest percentage of any county in the nation). The race was essentially over when Conaway announced his candidacy. He won in November with 77 percent of the vote, one of the largest percentages by anyone facing major-party opposition. He was reelected unopposed in 2006 and faced no major-party opposition in 2008.

Conaway endorsed former [[Massachusetts]] [[Governor of Massachusetts|Governor]] [[Mitt Romney]] for president in 2008.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

Conaway won re-nomination to a sixth term in the U.S. House in the Republican primary held on March 4, 2014. He polled 53,107 votes (73.7 percent); his challenger, Wade Brown, received 18,979 votes (26.3 percent).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://team1.sos.state.tx.us/enr/results/mar04_169_state.htm?x=0&y=218&id=176|title=Republican primary election returns, March 4, 2014|publisher=enr.sos.state.tx.us|accessdate=March 6, 2014}}</ref>

Conaway won re-election in the general election held on November 4, 2014. He polled 107,752 votes (90.27 percent); his challenger, Ryan T. Lange, received 11,607 (9.72 percent).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://team1.sos.state.tx.us/enr/results/nov04_175_state.htm?x=0&y=2262&id=650|title=2014 General Election Returns|publisher=enr.sos.state.tx.us|accessdate=November 6, 2014}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Conaway has long been friends with [[George W. Bush]], and the two mixed in many of the same social circles in Midland{{fact|date=October 2013}}.

Conaway served on the Midland Independent School District Board from 1985 to 1988.

==Party leadership==
In January 2007, Conaway began chairing the three-member audit committee for the [[National Republican Congressional Committee]]. By January 28, 2008, Conaway had uncovered a fraud, where hundreds of thousands of dollars were missing from NRCC bank accounts, and supposed annual audits on the NRCC books had actually not been performed since 2001.<ref>[http://archive.is/XAMdr  Suzanne Gamboa, "Texas lawmaker uncovers GOP committee fraud", Associated Press, published by the ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'' (March 13, 2008).]</ref>

Conaway is one of the few [[Certified Public Accountant]]s in Congress.

===Farm subsidies===
From 2003 through 2005, $14.7 billion in crop subsidies went to the congressional districts of members on the House Committee on Agriculture, an analysis by the non-partisan Environmental Working Group found. That was 42.4% of the total subsidies. Conaway is reported to have brought $322 million to his district.<ref>Dilanian, Ken, [http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2007-07-25-farmbill_N.htm#subsidies " Billions go to House panel members' districts"], USA Today. July 26, 2007.</ref>

==Political campaigns==
Conaway first ran for elective office in 2003, when he ran in a special election for the 19th Congressional District, which came open after 18-year Republican incumbent [[Larry Combest]] stepped down shortly after winning a 10th term. Conaway lost by 587 votes to fellow Republican [[Randy Neugebauer]]. A few months later, the [[Texas Legislature]] [[2003 Texas redistricting|redrew the state's districts]] in an effort engineered by then-[[House Majority Leader]] [[Tom DeLay]]. Three brand-new districts were created, one of them being the 11th, which was based in Midland. Previously, Midland had been part of the [[Lubbock, Texas|Lubbock]]-based 19th District. DeLay was particularly keen to draw a district based in Midland, Odessa and the oil-rich [[Permian Basin (North America)|Permian Basin]] in part because [[Texas House]] Speaker [[Tom Craddick]] was from that area. This district is heavily Republican&nbsp;— by some accounts, the most Republican district in Texas.  Republican candidates usually garner 70 percent or more of the vote in this area ([[Glasscock County]] had voted 93.1 percent for Bush in 2000, the highest percentage of any county in the nation). The race was essentially over when Conaway announced his candidacy. He won in November with 77 percent of the vote, one of the largest percentages by anyone facing major-party opposition. He was reelected unopposed in 2006 and faced no major-party opposition in 2008.

Conaway endorsed former [[Massachusetts]] [[Governor of Massachusetts|Governor]] [[Mitt Romney]] for president in 2008.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

Conaway won re-nomination to a sixth term in the U.S. House in the Republican primary held on March 4, 2014. He polled 53,107 votes (73.7 percent); his challenger, Wade Brown, received 18,979 votes (26.3 percent).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://team1.sos.state.tx.us/enr/results/mar04_169_state.htm?x=0&y=218&id=176|title=Republican primary election returns, March 4, 2014|publisher=enr.sos.state.tx.us|accessdate=March 6, 2014}}</ref>

Conaway won re-election in the general election held on November 4, 2014. He polled 107,752 votes (90.27 percent); his challenger, Ryan T. Lange, received 11,607 (9.72 percent).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://team1.sos.state.tx.us/enr/results/nov04_175_state.htm?x=0&y=2262&id=650|title=2014 General Election Returns|publisher=enr.sos.state.tx.us|accessdate=November 6, 2014}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Conaway has long been friends with [[George W. Bush]], and the two mixed in many of the same social circles in Midland{{fact|date=October 2013}}.

Conaway served on the Midland Independent School District Board from 1985 to 1988.
