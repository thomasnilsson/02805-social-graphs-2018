A [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], Buck was also the unsuccessful GOP challenger to [[Michael Bennet]] in the [[United States Senate election in Colorado, 2010|2010 Senate race in Colorado]].\n\n==Early life and education==\nBuck was born in [[Ossining (village), New York|Ossining, New York]] in 1959.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.politicsdaily.com/2010/10/04/how-old-is-ken-buck/|title=How Old Is Ken Buck?|date=2010-10-04|work=Politics Daily|accessdate=13 December 2013}}</ref> He and his two brothers were encouraged by their parents, both New York lawyers, to attend [[Ivy League]] colleges,<ref name=background/> and Buck earned his undergraduate degree from [[Princeton University]] in 1981.

He was also an instructor at the [[University of Denver]] Law School and for the [[National Institute for Trial Advocacy]] in Colorado.\n\n==Career==\n\n===U.S. Attorney\'s Office===\nIn 1986, he was hired by Congressman [[Dick Cheney]] to work on the [[Iran-Contra]] investigation.

The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] sued Buck\'s office for violating the privacy of the service\'s clients and after an appeal to the [[Colorado Supreme Court]], costing the county approximately $150,000, the raid was deemed unconstitutional.<ref name=background/> Buck has said that his time enforcing laws for the Justice Department and Weld County stoked his desire to become a lawmaker himself.<ref name=background/>\n\nDuring the 2010 Senate race, \'\'The Colorado Independent\'\' ran an article entitled "Suspect in 2005 Buck [[rape]] case said he knew it was rape,".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://coloradoindependent.com/63925/suspect-in-troubling-05-buck-case-said-he-knew-it-was-rape|title=Suspect in troubling \'05 Buck case said he knew it was rape|work=[[The Colorado Independent]]|accessdate=13 December 2013}}</ref>  The article, about a case Buck refused to prosecute in 2006, included a complete transcript of a tape between the victim and her attacker, including the following dialogue:\n{{quote|\nVictim: \xe2\x80\x9cYou do realize that \xe2\x80\xa6 it\xe2\x80\x99s rape.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSuspect: \xe2\x80\x9cYeah, I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nVictim: \xe2\x80\x9cLike in a number of different ways, because I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to do it and because I was intoxicated and because I was afraid.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSuspect: \xe2\x80\x9cYes I do.

Had he (Buck) not attacked me, I might have let it go. But he put the blame on me, and I was furious. I still am furious,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\nAccording to the \'\'Independent\'\', "A man entered the alleged victim\xe2\x80\x99s apartment and had sex with her while she was drunk, she says. As she passed in and out of consciousness, she says she told him \xe2\x80\x9cno\xe2\x80\x9d and tried to push him away. If he had been a stranger, the case may have played out differently, but he was a former lover, and she had invited him over."\n\nIn the meeting that she recorded, Buck said, \xe2\x80\x9cIt appears to me \xe2\x80\xa6 that you invited him over to have sex with him," and that he thought she might have wanted to file rape charges to retaliate against the man for some bad feeling left over from when they had been lovers more than a year earlier. According the \'\'Independent\'\', "Buck also comes off on this tape as being at least as concerned with the woman\xe2\x80\x99s sexual history and alcohol consumption as he is with other facts of the case."\n\nDrawing on Buck\'s abortion stance, the \'\'Independent\'\' also points out that "The suspect in this case had claimed that the victim had at one point a year or so before this event become pregnant with his child and had an [[abortion]], which she denies, saying she [[miscarriage|miscarried]]. The suspect\xe2\x80\x99s claim, though, is in the police report, and Buck refers to it as a reason she may be motivated to file charges where he thinks none are warranted."\n<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.salon.com/life/broadsheet/2010/10/12/ken_buck/index.html|title=Rape case catches up with Ken Buck - Salon.com|date=2010-10-12|work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]|accessdate=13 December 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Political positions==\nBuck opposes [[abortion]], including in cases of [[rape]] and [[incest]], but makes exceptions if the mother\xe2\x80\x99s life is in danger.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://buckforcolorado.com/respect-life|title=Respect for Life|work=Buck campaign website}} {{dead link|date=December 2013}}</ref>\n\nBuck supports the U.S. military\'s "[[Don\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell]]" policy.
