He has been the Assistant Majority Leader of the [[Wisconsin Senate]], representing the [[Wisconsin Senate, District 20|20th District]] in southeastern Wisconsin since 2005. The district includes the city of [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], other parts of [[Washington County, Wisconsin|Washington County]], and parts of [[Fond du Lac County, Wisconsin|Fond du Lac]], [[Dodge County, Wisconsin|Dodge]],  [[Sheboygan County, Wisconsin|Sheboygan]], and [[Ozaukee County, Wisconsin|Ozaukee]] counties. Previously, Grothman served in the [[Wisconsin State Assembly]], representing the 58th Assembly District from 1993 until 2005, served as the vice chair of the Assembly\'s Republican caucus from 1999 to 2004, and as Wisconsin Senator from the 20th district from 2005 to 2015, and Assistant Majority Leader of the [[Wisconsin Senate]] from 2011 to 2015.\n\n==Early life and education==\nGrothman graduated from [[Homestead High School (Mequon, Wisconsin)|Homestead High School]] in [[Mequon, Wisconsin|Mequon]], and attended the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]] for his undergraduate degree.<ref name="official bio"/> In 1983, he received his [[Juris Doctor|law degree]] from the [[University of Wisconsin Law School]].\n\n==Wisconsin legislature==\nGrothman was elected to the 58th Assembly District in a special election held in December 1993. From 1999 to 2004, he was the Assembly Majority Caucus Vice Chairperson. In 2004, he challenged State Senate Majority Leader [[Mary Panzer]] in the Republican primary.  He ran well to Panzer\'s right, charging that she was insufficiently conservative.<ref>http://badgerherald.com/news/2004/09/17/grothman_makes_rare_.php</ref>  He won the nomination in a rout, taking 79 percent of the vote to Panzer\'s 21 percent.<ref>[http://165.189.88.185/docview.asp?docid=1382&locid=47 Wisconsin State Elections Board, Results for September 14, 2004]</ref>  He was unopposed in the general election for this heavily Republican district.<ref name=2004results/> From 2007 to 2008, he was the Senate Minority Caucus Chairperson.

He believes concealed carry laws would deter criminal behavior, with permits being awarded to law-abiding citizens who pass a [[gun safety]] course.<ref>{{cite web|last=Grothman|first=Glenn|title=A Good Idea|url=http://www.grothman.org/AD58/031001AD58.pdf|publisher=grothman.org}}</ref>\n\nGrothman co-introduced 2011 SB 93, which was signed into law by Governor [[Scott Walker (politician)|Scott Walker]]<ref>{{cite web|title=2011 SB 93|url=https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2011/proposals/reg/sen/bill/sb93|publisher=Legislative Reference Bureau|accessdate=4 April 2014}}</ref> This bill made Wisconsin the 49th state to legalize concealed carry.<ref>{{cite news|last=Gardner|first=Brent|title=Wisconsin to Become 49th State to Allow Right-to-Carry|url=http://www.nranews.com/a1f/video/wisconsin-to-become-49th-state-to-allow-right-to-carry/list/concealed-carry|accessdate=4 April 2014|newspaper=NRA News|date=24 June 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Equal pay ===\nSpeaking in support of Governor [[Scott Walker (politician)|Scott Walker\'s]] decision to repeal the Wisconsin Equal Pay Act, Grothman stated that the alleged pay differential is explainable: "Once you break it down by married and unmarried, the differential disappears." \n<ref name="Daily Beast">{{cite web|last=Goldberg|first=Michelle|title=Wisconsin\xe2\x80\x99s Repeal of Equal Pay Rights Adds to Battles for Women|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/04/07/wisconsin-s-repeal-of-equal-pay-rights-adds-to-battles-for-women.html|work=The Daily Beast|accessdate=4 April 2014}}</ref> However, a study by the American Association of University Women in 2007 found that life choices and family circumstances explain only a portion of the difference in pay between genders. Grothman rejected that study, further claiming, "You could argue that money is more important for men.

In a recent press interview, he said that he did not "find it impressive" that over 70,000 protesters marched on the capitol.<ref name="protests not"/>\n\nDuring the protests, Grothman was cornered by almost 200 pro-union protesters yelling "Shame! Shame!" outside the state capitol building. Grothman said he was not concerned about violence at the time, adding that, "They\'re loud, they\'ll give you the finger, and they yell at you, but I really think deep down inside they\'re just mostly college kids having fun, just like they\'re having fun sleeping with their girlfriends on air mattresses. That\'s the guts of that crowd." He also described the protesters as "a different breed of person" and "a bunch of slobs taking up the building."<ref name="lawmaker chased"/><ref name="slobs"/>\n\nDuring this time, Grothman also advocated the hiring of more business-friendly individuals to the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources.  In doing so, he went out of his way to single out one of the University of Wisconsin campuses as a target: "Maybe you (should) look to hire those people who know what the real world is like, rather than a recent graduate from UW-Stevens Point who doesn\'t know what the real world is like."
