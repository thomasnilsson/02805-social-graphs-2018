==Early life and education==

He earned his [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in [[Accounting]] and [[Finance]] in 1977 from [[California State University, Fullerton]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www2.calstate.edu/impact-of-the-csu/government/federal-relations/Pages/csu-alumni.aspx|title=CSU Alumni|website=www2.calstate.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-07}}</ref> 

==Early career==
Royce was a business owner and [[corporate tax]] manager for a [[Portland cement]] company before becoming a [[California State Senate|California State Senator]] in 1983, serving in that post until his election to the U.S. House of Representatives.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Elections===
After redistricting following the [[1990 United States Census]], incumbent Republican U.S. Representative [[William Dannemeyer]] decided to retire and run for the [[United States Senate election in California, 1992|1992 U.S. Senate election]]. Royce won the Republican primary for what was then [[California's 39th congressional district]], which included most of northern Orange County and southern Los Angeles County.

He defeated Democrat Molly McClanahan in the general election with 57% of the vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=27873|title=CA District 39 Race|date=November 3, 1992|publisher=Our Campaigns|accessdate=2017-04-03}}</ref>

He won re-election to the 39th district four more times with at least 63% of the vote.

After redistricting, Royce's home in Fullerton was drawn into the 39th district. That district had previously been the 42nd District, represented by fellow Republican [[Gary Miller]]. Although it was geographically more Miller's district than Royce's, Royce would have been favored in a primary battle with Miller–which would have been the real contest in this heavily Republican district. Ultimately, Miller opted to move to the neighboring 31st District,<ref>Trygstad, Kyle.
