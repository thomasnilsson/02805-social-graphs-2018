===1998 congressional election===
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections, 1998}}
In 1998, U.S. Congresswoman [[Jane Harman]] declined to run for re-election, choosing instead to run for [[Governor of California]]. Hahn then won the Democratic nomination to succeed Harman, but lost the general election to Republican State Assemblyman [[Steven T. Kuykendall]] 49%-47%.<ref name="1998 cong"/>

==Los Angeles City Council (2001–2011)==
[[Image:Janice Hahn 1.JPG|left|thumb|200px|Hahn giving a speech in 2007]]
Hahn served on the Los Angeles City Council, representing the 15th District, from 2001-11. The 15th District encompasses the San Pedro Harbor and includes the ethnically diverse communities of [[Harbor City, Los Angeles|Harbor City]], [[Harbor Gateway, Los Angeles|Harbor Gateway]], [[San Pedro, Los Angeles|San Pedro]], [[Watts, California|Watts]] and [[Wilmington, California|Wilmington]].<ref name="zip codes"/> She was reelected to her third and final term in November 2009.<ref name="about Janice"/>

She has been called "one of the most pro-labor members" of the City Council, and a "consistent opponent of layoffs and furloughs for city workers."<ref name="labor endorsement"/> Hahn walked the picket lines with unionized dockworkers in 2002.<ref name="stay away"/> After the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] suggested it would intervene in the labor dispute by using government troops to operate the ports, Hahn urged non-intervention.<ref name="stay away"/> "'There's no room for the federal government. There's only one reason for them to get involved, and that's to break the union', she said."<ref name="stay away"/> She was the leading force on the City Council behind both the passage of a living wage ordinance for the hotel workers along Century Boulevard near Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) and the provision of improved health benefits to LAX employees.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Hahn cites her efforts to clean up the Port of Los Angeles as one of her main accomplishments while on the City Council. The 2006 Clean Air Action Plan, which she and Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa pushed forward, set a goal of reducing pollution by 45 percent within five years and shifted the movement of goods at the ports to off-peak traffic hours.<ref name="campaign platform"/> Hahn supported the addition of the Clean Trucks Program that requires the 16,000 diesel trucks serving the ports meet 2007 EPA emission standards within five years.<ref name="campaign platform"/><ref name="clean truck"/> She has noted that the ports have been Southern California's largest emitter of greenhouse gasses and diesel emissions and that the Clean Trucks Program also provides for improved working conditions, wages and benefits for port truckers.<ref name="clean truck"/> Prior to the Clean Air Action Plan, she had already shifted about 35% of goods to be moved during off-peak hours. Hahn also helped advance redevelopment projects at the Port of Los Angeles in both San Pedro and Wilmington.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

On the City Council, Hahn was a major proponent of gang prevention, intervention, and suppression programs. She led the campaign to pass Measure A, which would have dedicated a sustainable revenue stream for those programs, but fell just shy of the two thirds percentage needed to pass. On a smaller level, she expanded the Gang Alternatives Program to all elementary schools in her district.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

==2010 Lieutenant Gubernatorial election==
{{Main|California lieutenant gubernatorial election, 2010}}

===Elections===
;2011
{{Main|California's 36th congressional district special election, 2011}}
On February 7, 2011, Hahn announced her intention to run for the U.S. House of Representatives in the special election to fill California's 36th Congressional District seat vacated by Congresswoman [[Jane Harman]]'s departure to head the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.

[[Image:JaniceHahn2011.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Janice Hahn in 2011]]
Hahn was one of sixteen candidates from all parties who competed in the [[California's 36th congressional district special election, 2011|special election primary]] on May 17, 2011.<ref name="times endorses"/> She finished first with 24 percent of the vote; Republican [[Craig Huey]] finished second with 22 percent. Because no candidate received more than 50 percent, Hahn and Huey, the top two finishers, faced off in a special runoff election on July 12.<ref name="times endorses"/> Many had expected [[California Secretary of State]] [[Debra Bowen]] to secure one of the top two spots, but Bowen finished in third place.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

The Los Angeles County Federation of Labor, [[AFL–CIO]], endorsed Hahn in March 2011, a move the ''[[Daily Breeze]]'' called "significant" because of the fundraising and get-out-the-vote power of the large organization.<ref name="labor"/> As of March 23, 2011, Hahn had received endorsements from Senator [[Dianne Feinstein]], Los Angeles Mayor [[Antonio Villaraigosa]], Los Angeles County Sheriff [[Lee Baca]], California Assembly Speaker [[John A. Pérez]], California State Senator [[Ted Lieu]], Torrance Firefighters Association Local 1138, and other notable figures such as former [[Los Angeles Lakers|LA Laker]] [[Magic Johnson|Earvin "Magic" Johnson]] and environmentalist and actor [[Ed Begley, Jr.]].<ref name="endorsements"/>

On April 25, 2011, Hahn secured the endorsement of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.<ref name="times endorses"/> Following her victory in the primary, Hahn was endorsed by California Democrats Governor [[Jerry Brown]], Lieutenant Governor [[Gavin Newsom]] (who defeated Hahn in the 2010 primary race for Lieutenant Governor), House Minority Leader [[Nancy Pelosi]] and House Minority Whip [[Steny Hoyer]] of Maryland. [[Emily's List]], an organization that supports women candidates who support abortion rights also endorsed Hahn.<ref name="emily's list"/> On June 5, 2011, Hahn was officially endorsed by primary opponent Marcy Winograd, [[California State Controller]] [[John Chiang (California politician)|John Chiang]], Assemblyman [[Warren Furutani]] and Assemblywoman [[Betsy Butler]], as well as the gun-control group [[Brady Campaign]].

A poll conducted by the ''[[Daily Kos]]'' and [[Service Employees International Union]] shortly before the July 2011 election had Hahn in the lead over Huey by 8 points, (52 percent to 44 percent) with 4 percent undecided.<ref name=poll/> Her final margin of victory was 9 points, 54.56 percent to 45.44.<ref name="2011 election results"/>

;2012
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in California, 2012#District 44}}
After redistricting dismantled her old district, Hahn decided to run in the newly redrawn [[California's 44th congressional district|44th district]], which included her home in San Pedro. That district had previously been the 37th, represented by fellow Democratic Congresswoman [[Laura Richardson]]. The [[California Democratic Party]] endorsed Hahn.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://atr.rollcall.com/california-democratic-party-endorses-hahn-over-richardson|title=California Democratic Party Endorses Janice Hahn over Laura Richardson|first=Kyle|last=Trygstad|newspaper=Roll Call|location=Washington, D.C.|accessdate=November 11, 2016}}</ref>

In the all-party primary (created as a result of [[California Proposition 14 (2010)|Proposition 14]]), she finished first over Richardson by a wide margin, taking 60 percent of the vote to Richardson's 40 percent.  This was all the more remarkable since Hahn was running in territory that was more than 60 percent new to her. In the general election, Hahn defeated Richardson with 60.2 percent of the vote to Richardson's 39.7 percent.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}
