In July 2007, Garrett proposed an amendment to strike earmarked money in a spending bill for native [[Alaska]]n and [[Hawaii]]an educational programs.<ref name="young">[http://www.politico.com/blogs/thecrypt/0707/North_to_Alaska.html North to Alaska], ''The Politico'' dated July 17, 2007.</ref> Congressman [[Don Young]] of Alaska defended the funds on the floor of the House, saying, "You want my money, my money."<ref name="young"/> Young went on to suggest that Republicans had lost their majority in the 2006 election because some Republicans had challenged spending [[Earmark (politics)|earmarks]].<ref name="young"/> While Garrett did not ask for an official reprimand, other conservative Republicans took exception to Young's remarks that the funds in question represented his money. Members of the [[Republican Study Committee]] gave Garrett a standing ovation later in the day during the group's weekly meeting.<ref name="young"/>

===LGBT issues===
Following the legalization of same-sex marriage in the United States by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in 2015, Garrett supported the [[First Amendment Defense Act]], a bill allowing companies to deny service to same-sex weddings due to religious objections.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Salant|first1=Jonathan D.|url=http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2015/07/two_nj_republican_congressmen_join_legislative_res.html|title=2 N.J. lawmakers back denying services to gay couples on religious grounds|work=NJ.com|date=July 10, 2015|accessdate=March 25, 2016}}</ref>

Also in 2015, Garrett refused to pay GOP campaign arm dues to the [[National Republican Congressional Committee]] because he said they were "actively recruiting homosexual candidates and had supported gay candidates in the past."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/gop-garrett-hensarling-no-cash-for-campaign-arm-because-it-backs-gays-120201.html|title=GOP lawmaker: No cash for campaign arm because it backs gays|work=POLITICO|accessdate=March 25, 2016}}</ref> Garrett later clarified his remarks, saying that he is opposed to same-sex marriage due to his faith, but that he does not "have malice" toward any group of people.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Salant|first1=Jonathan D.|title=N.J.

===Suffrage===
In 2006, Garrett was the only congressman from New Jersey to vote against the reauthorization of the [[Voting Rights Act]], citing his opposition to requirements to print non-English ballots.<ref>Llorente, Elizabeth. [https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-126549189.html "Group rallies against Garrett"], ''[[The Record (Bergen County)]]'', July 21, 2006. Accessed February 10, 2016. "And recently, Rep. Scott Garrett, R-Wantage, was the only member of New Jersey's congressional delegation to vote against extending the Voting Rights Act, because he opposed a provision that called for printing ballots in languages other than English."</ref>

==Export-Import Bank nomination==
On April 14, 2017, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Donald Trump]] announced that he would nominate Garrett to become chairman and president of the [[Export–Import Bank of the United States]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Stevenson |first=Alexandra |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/14/business/export-import-bank-trump-scott-garrett.html |title=In Reversal, Trump Names Pick to Reshape Export-Import Bank, Not End It |publisher=NYTimes.com |date=2017-04-14 |accessdate=2017-04-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Shindler|first1=Michael|title=Trump’s Ex-Im Picks Signal Reform Is On The Way |url=https://townhall.com/columnists/youngvoicesadvocates/2017/04/30/trumps-exim-picks-signals-reform-is-on-the-way-n2320140|accessdate=15 May 2017|publisher=Townhall|date=April 30, 2017}}</ref> While in the House of Representatives, Garrett was a critic of the bank's existence.<ref name="Warmbrodt"/> On June 19, 2017, Trump formally nominated Garrett to the post, which requires confirmation by the [[United States Senate]].<ref name="Warmbrodt"/>

In August 2017, ''Politico'' reported that Trump would give Garrett a chance to rescue his nomination after privately questioning whether the nomination should proceed. Conservatives opposed to the Ex-Im Bank "have ratcheted up pressure on the administration to stick with Garrett’s nomination." Republican U.S. Senator [[Pat Toomey]] said: "I can tell you there will be Republican senators including myself who will put up quite a fight if his nomination doesn't go forward."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Warmbrodt|first1=Zachary|last2=Restuccia|first2=Andrew|title=Trump gives Ex-Im pick a chance to rescue nomination|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2017/08/02/trump-import-export-garrett-241270|accessdate=3 August 2017|publisher=Politico|date=August 2, 2017}}</ref>

On December 19, 2017, the [[United States Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs|Senate Banking Committee]] voted by a margin of 10-13 not to advance Garrett's nomination to the full U.S. Senate.
