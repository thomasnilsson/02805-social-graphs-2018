==Early life, education and career==
Yarmuth was born in [[Louisville, Kentucky]], the son of Edna E. (née Klein) and Stanley R. Yarmuth. He is descended from Jewish immigrants from Russia and Austria.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~battle/reps/yarmuth.htm |title=yarmuth |publisher=Freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com |date= |accessdate=October 11, 2012}}</ref> He graduated from [[Atherton High School]].<ref name=bio>[http://yarmuth.house.gov/johns-biography/ Official House Biography] Retrieved July 5, 2012.</ref> He later graduated from [[Yale University]], majoring in American Studies, and attended [[Georgetown University Law Center]].<ref name=bio />

He worked for Republican [[U.S. Senator]] [[Marlow Cook]] from 1971 to 1975, then returned to [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]] and launched his publishing career by founding the ''Louisville Today'' magazine, which operated from 1976 to 1982. He later worked as a vice-president of University Relations at the [[University of Louisville]].<ref name=bio />

==Publisher and columnist==
In 1990, Yarmuth founded the ''[[Louisville Eccentric Observer]]'' (LEO), a weekly newspaper for which he wrote a generally [[progressivism|progressive]] political column that was usually featured on the first page. In 2003, Yarmuth sold LEO to a company owned by [[Times Publishing Company]] of [[Pennsylvania]], owner of the ''[[Erie Times-News]].'' Yarmuth remained on board as a columnist and consultant until January 2006, when he put his column on hiatus to run for Congress.<ref name=bio />

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Tenure===
Yarmuth took office on January 3, 2007. As of 2017, he is serving his sixth term as Congressman.

After his first year in Congress, Yarmuth donated his post-tax congressional salary of just over $120,000 to various charities in Louisville.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yarmuthforcongress.com/yarmuth.php/news/yarmuth-donates-2007-congressional-salary-to-louisville-non-profit-organizations |title=Yarmuth For Congress » Campaign Blog » Yarmuth Donates 2007 Congressional Salary to Louisville Non-Profit Organizations |accessdate=January 19, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080412080919/http://www.yarmuthforcongress.com/yarmuth.php/news/yarmuth-donates-2007-congressional-salary-to-louisville-non-profit-organizations |archivedate=April 12, 2008 |df= }}</ref>

On February 8, 2008, Yarmuth endorsed [[Barack Obama]] in his bid for the Democratic Party nomination for [[President of the United States]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Yarmuth endorses Obama |date=February 8, 2008 |work=[[The Courier-Journal]] |author=Carroll, James |url=http://www.courier-journal.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080208/NEWS01/80208013/1008/NEWS01}}{{dead link|date=April 2009}}</ref>

On September 29, 2008, Yarmuth voted against the TARP bailout plan, as negotiated by House Speaker [[Nancy Pelosi]],  Senate Majority Leader [[Harry Reid]], President [[George W. Bush]], House Minority Leader [[John Boehner]], and Senate Minority Leader [[Mitch McConnell]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Four Congressmen vote No |date=September 29, 2008 |work=[[Lexington Herald Leader]] |author=Abdullah, Halimah |url=http://www.kentucky.com/181/story/540032.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081004031451/http://www.kentucky.com/181/story/540032.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=October 4, 2008 |df= }}</ref>  However, he did vote in favor of the second version of the bailout bill.<ref>{{cite news|title=Yarmuth Thinks Bailout Bill Stinks, Votes For It Anyway |url=http://www.beloblog.com/WHAS_Blogs/PoliticalBlogger/2008/10/yarmuth-thinks-bailout-bill-st.html |publisher=[[WHAS-TV]] |date=October 3, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202221210/http://www.beloblog.com/WHAS_Blogs/PoliticalBlogger/2008/10/yarmuth-thinks-bailout-bill-st.html |archivedate=December 2, 2008 }}</ref>

Yarmuth said he was so "nauseated" by a moment of silence for [[Michael Jackson]] on the House floor that he left the chamber. "I thought it was outrageous," he said. "In my two and a half years, we've not done this for anybody else. We've done it for former members and that's about it."<ref>{{cite web|last=Petchenik|first=Mike|title=Yarmuth 'Nauseated' By Jackson Tribute|url=http://www.wlky.com/news/19995422/detail.html|work=WLKY.com|accessdate=April 11, 2012}}{{dead link|date=November 2013}}</ref>

After defeating Northup for the second time, Yarmuth was rewarded by the [[Democratic Steering and Policy Committee]] with a spot on the influential [[United States House Committee on Ways and Means|Ways and Means Committee]]. On the committee, Yarmuth worked on issues on which he campaigned before the 2008 general election: [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]], [[pension]], [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], and [[Medicaid]] issues.

At a September 2009 town hall meeting, constituents were unhappy with Yarmuth's decision to support the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]]. "Yarmuth stayed calm in the face of boos and catcalls from some in the audience" according to an Associated Press report. "He warned that the current health care system is an unsustainable drain on businesses and the nation's economy."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wbko.com/news/headlines/56885527.html |title=Yarmuth faces boisterous town hall meeting |publisher=WBKO |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105180025/http://www.wbko.com/news/headlines/56885527.html |archivedate=November 5, 2013 |df= }}</ref>

In 2011, Yarmuth introduced a bill alongside Republican Congressman [[Walter B. Jones, Jr.|Walter Jones]] that would seek to overturn key parts of the controversial court case ''[[Citizens United v. FEC]]''. The legislation would also give Congress the power to enact mandatory public financing for Congressional candidates and create a national holiday for voting purposes.<ref>{{cite web|author=Phillip M.

In 2011, Yarmuth voted against the [[National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012]] due to a controversial provision which allows the government and the military to indefinitely detain American citizens and others without trial.<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/ndaa-bill-how-did-your-congress-member-vote-384362?page=1 |title=NDAA Bill: How Did Your Congress Member Vote? |publisher=Ibtimes.com |date=December 16, 2011 |accessdate=October 11, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=House Vote 291 - Passes the {{sic|nolink=y|the}} National Defense Authorization Act|url=http://politics.nytimes.com/congress/votes/112/house/2/291|work=Inside Congress|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|accessdate=September 27, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120522011114/http://politics.nytimes.com/congress/votes/112/house/2/291|archivedate=May 22, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

In 2013, Yarmuth introduced the [[Fair Elections Now Act]], which would establish a public financing system for Congressional campaigns.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://yarmuth.house.gov/get-money-out-of-politics/ |title=Congressman John Yarmuth : Get Money Out of Politics |website=Yarmuth.house.gov |date=October 14, 2016 |accessdate=November 12, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://yarmuth.house.gov/press/rep-yarmuth-introduces-public-financing-bill-to-get-money-out-of-politics/ |title=Congressman John Yarmuth : Press : Rep.

In 2015, Yarmuth once again made an attempt at removing "dark money" from the political sphere by Proposing HR 2125, the Keeping our Campaigns Honest Act of 2015, however the bill realistically had no chance of passing in the 114th Congress in which it was proposed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/114/hr2125|title=Keeping Our Campaigns Honest Act of 2015 (H.R. 2125)|publisher=GovTrack.us|accessdate=December 23, 2016}}</ref>

Yarmuth signed onto a "Medicare for All" bill in the House, along with 120 other Democrats in 2018, supporting [[single-payer healthcare]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Sullivan|first1=Peter|title=Democrats march toward single-payer health care|url=http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/375376-democrats-march-toward-single-payer-health-care|website=The Hill|accessdate=25 February 2018}}</ref>

==Political campaigns==

===2006===
Yarmuth filed candidacy papers on January 31, 2006, to represent {{ushr|Kentucky|3|}}. Having won the Democratic primary on May 16, defeating [[Andrew Horne]], Burrell Charles Farnsley and James W. Moore, he defeated incumbent [[Anne Northup]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]) in November of that year.

On August 7, 2006, ''[[The Courier-Journal]]'' reported that ''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]'' revealed a week before that the [[Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee]] had earmarked $51.5 million for television advertising in 32 congressional districts across the nation, but none for Yarmuth's challenge in the Third Congressional District.<ref>{{cite news |title=National Democratic campaign doesn't plan ads for Yarmuth |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/courier_journal/access/1755353091.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Aug+7,+2006&author=&pub=Courier+-+Journal&edition=&startpage=A.1&desc=National+Democratic+campaign+doesn't+plan+ads+for+Yarmuth |work=[[The Courier-Journal]] |date=August 7, 2006 |last=Stewart |first=Kay |accessdate=September 1, 2006}}</ref>

On October 20, a ''Courier-Journal'' article stated that a [[WHAS-TV|WHAS11]]/[[SurveyUSA]] poll revealed the race had tightened dramatically, with Yarmuth leading Northup 48 to 47 percent. Another poll a month earlier had Northup leading by 6 points.<ref>{{cite news |title=Poll: Northup, Yarmuth race in dead heat |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/courier_journal/access/1755385121.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Jul+20,+2006&author=&pub=Courier+-+Journal&edition=&startpage=B.1&desc=Rep.+Northup's+campaign+cash+far+exceeds+that+of+foe+Yarmuth |last=Stewart |first=Kay |work=[[The Courier-Journal]] |date=October 20, 2006 |accessdate=November 9, 2006}}</ref> A WHAS11/SurveyUSA poll released on November 2 showed Yarmuth leading Northup 52 to 44 percent.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.whas11.com/news/politics/local/stories/WHAS11_TOP_SurveyUSAPollYarmuthNorthup.e9a3004.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070211160301/http://www.whas11.com/news/politics/local/stories/WHAS11_TOP_SurveyUSAPollYarmuthNorthup.e9a3004.html |archivedate=February 11, 2007 |title=Yarmuth ahead in new poll |date=November 2, 2006 |accessdate=November 9, 2006 |work=whas11.com |first=Mark |last=Hebert}}</ref>

On October 26, Yarmuth told ''Courier-Journal'' reporter Kay Stewart that he would donate his congressional salary—which would be $168,500 in 2007—to local charity.<ref>{{cite news |title=Northup attacks Yarmuth's Wealth -- Hypocrisy? |url=http://northupforcongress.blogspot.com/2006/10/northup-attacks-yarmuths-wealth.html |last=Stewart |first=Kay |work=[[The Courier-Journal]] |date=October 26, 2006 |accessdate=January 2, 2008}}</ref>

Because polls close early in Kentucky, many analysts saw this race as a key indicator and it immediately became one of the most watched House races in the nation.

Yarmuth defeated Northup in the general election. He garnered 122,139 votes (51%) to Northup's 116,157 votes (48%). Independent candidates garnered 2,896 votes (1%).

===2018===
On April 17, 2017, Yarmuth announced that he would run for a seventh term in the 2018 election.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://weku.fm/post/congressman-john-yarmuth-run-re-election-2018|title=Congressman John Yarmuth Running for reelection in 2018|website=weku.fm|accessdate= April 18, 2017}}</ref>

==Television==
In 2003, Yarmuth and former [[WHAS-AM]] radio talk show host [[John Ziegler (talk show host)|John Ziegler]] debated political issues on the weekly [[WAVE (TV)|WAVE]] program ''Yarmuth & Ziegler'', with Yarmuth taking the [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] side and Ziegler, the [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] side. On a successor program, ''Hot Button'', which ran from September 2004 to December 2005, he faced off with conservative Jim Milliman.

Yarmuth appeared on the March 8, 2007, episode of ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' in the show's "[[Better Know a District]]" series. In a parody of Yarmuth's former ''Yarmuth & Ziegler'' debate series, host [[Stephen Colbert (character)|Stephen Colbert]] prodded Yarmuth into a point/counterpoint style debate. After agreeing to the "debate," Colbert forced Yarmuth to defend the shredding of [[kitten]]s in [[wood chipper]]s, which Yarmuth gamely proceeded to do. Colbert referred to Yarmuth as a real life [[Bruce Wayne]], and presented him with a framed print of his congressional photo with a [[Batman]] mask photoshopped over his face.<ref>{{cite news |first=James R. |last=Carroll |title=Yarmuth jokes on the 'Colbert Report' |work=[[The Courier-Journal]] |date=March 9, 2007 | accessdate=March 9, 2007 |url=http://www.courier-journal.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070309/NEWS01/70309021}}</ref>

Yarmuth and his wife, Cathy Yarmuth, have one son, Aaron, who is a graduate of Kentucky Country Day. Aaron is currently the owner of the ''Louisville Eccentric Observer''.
