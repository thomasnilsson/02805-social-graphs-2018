====North Fork Watershed Protection Act====
On June 5, 2013, Daines introduced the [[North Fork Watershed Protection Act of 2013]] which would withdraw 430,000 acres of [[federal lands]] in [[Montana]] from programs to develop geothermal and mineral resources.<ref name=2259cbo>{{cite web|title=CBO - H.R. 2259|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/45094|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=March 2, 2014}}</ref><ref name=MissoulianScott1>{{cite news|last=Scott|first=Tristan|title=Daines to introduce legislation protecting North Fork Flathead|url=http://missoulian.com/news/local/daines-to-introduce-legislation-protecting-north-fork-flathead/article_05196d26-989a-11e2-b5f0-001a4bcf887a.html|accessdate=March 4, 2014|newspaper=Missoulian|date=March 30, 2013}}</ref> The law would forbid [[mountaintop removal mining]] and other [[natural resource]] development.<ref name="MissoulianScott1"/> The affected lands lie adjacent to [[Glacier National Park (U.S.)|Glacier National Park]] and already have some protections.<ref name="2259cbo"/> Rep. Daines emphasized his desire "to rise above partisan politics, preserve the  pristine landscape, and 'protect this critical watershed'," when he announced that he would be introducing the bill.<ref name="MissoulianScott1"/>  According to Daines, both conservationists and energy companies support the bill.<ref name="MissoulianScott1"/> The bill, also supported by Tester and Walsh, passed in the House; but Senate Republicans prevented it from being voted on, killing it in the Senate.<ref>{{cite web|last=Scott|first=Tristan|url=http://www.flatheadbeacon.com/articles/article/north_fork_watershed_protection_act_passes_u.s._house/38154|title=North Fork Watershed Protection Act Passes U.S. House|work=Flathead Beacon|date=March 4, 2014|accessdate=June 6, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Walsh|first=John|url=http://votesmart.org/public-statement/861626/walsh-disappointed-that-senate-fails-to-pass-landmark-conservation-bill-to-protect-north-fork#.U5GybfmwI7s|title=Walsh Disappointed that Senate Fails to Pass Landmark Conservation Bill to Protect North Fork|work=votesmart.org|date=April 3, 2014|accessdate=June 6, 2014}}</ref>

===Agriculture===

===Taxes===
Daines has vocally opposed an Internet sales tax, which would allow states to collect taxes on online sales.

===National security===

Daines supported President [[Donald Trump]]'s 2017 [[Executive Order 13769|executive order]] to impose a temporary ban on entry to the U.S. to citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries. He stated that "We are at war with Islamic extremists and anything less than 100 percent verification of these refugees' backgrounds puts our national security at risk. We need to take the time to examine our existing programs to ensure terrorists aren't entering our country. The safety of U.S. citizens must be our number one priority."<ref name="Blake1">{{cite web|last1=Blake|first1=Aaron|title=Coffman, Gardner join Republicans against President Trump's travel ban; here's where the rest stand|url=http://www.denverpost.com/2017/01/29/republicans-on-trump-travel-ban/|website=Denver Post|accessdate=January 30, 2017}}</ref>

===Elizabeth Warren===
On February 8, 2017, Senator Daines, while presiding over the U.S. Senate invoked [[Standing Rules of the United States Senate, Rule XIX|Rule 19 of the U.S. Senate]] to prevent Senator [[Elizabeth Warren]] (D-MA) from reading a letter [[Coretta Scott King]] wrote about then-[[United States Attorney]] for Alabama [[Jeff Sessions]] during the 1986 U.S. Senate confirmation hearing for Sessions's appointment as a [[United States federal judge]].<ref name=WaPo-170208 /> King's letter, addressed to Senator [[Strom Thurmond]] (R-SC), describes a 1984 prosecution by Sessions of [[Albert Turner (civil rights activist)|Albert Turner]] and other members of the Perry County Civic League for voting fraud.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/08/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-coretta-scott-king-jeff-sessions.html |title=Coretta Scott King's 1986 Statement to the Senate About Jeff Sessions |author=McCann, Erin |date=February 8, 2017 |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=February 18, 2017}}</ref> Since Sessions was (in 2017) a sitting United States Senator (R-AL), the reading of the letter from 1986 during the 2017 confirmation hearing for Sessions's appointment as [[United States Attorney General]] would be impugning Senator Sessions.<ref name=WaPo-170208>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2017/02/07/republicans-vote-to-rebuke-elizabeth-warren-for-impugning-sessionss-character/ |title=Republicans vote to rebuke Elizabeth Warren, saying she impugned Session's character |author1=Kane, Paul |author2=O'Keefe, Ed |date=February 8, 2017 |newspaper=The Washington Post |accessdate=February 18, 2017}}</ref> Daines was assisted by [[Elizabeth MacDonough]], the current [[Parliamentarian of the United States Senate]], who read the language of Rule 19 to freshman Senator Daines.<ref name=Lutey-Gazette /> Senator Daines "carefully repeated the language of Rule 19" while censuring Senator Warren.<ref name=Lutey-Gazette>{{cite news |url=http://billingsgazette.com/news/daines-stands-by-decision-to-gavel-down-warren/article_df41fd1b-c7af-5a4b-b3ed-d3fb54cceff6.html |title=Daines stands by decision to gavel down Warren |author=Lutey, Tom |date=February 8, 2017 |newspaper=Billings Gazette |accessdate=February 17, 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170217163644/http://billingsgazette.com/news/daines-stands-by-decision-to-gavel-down-warren/article_df41fd1b-c7af-5a4b-b3ed-d3fb54cceff6.html |archivedate=February 17, 2017 |deadurl=no}}</ref>

===Senate rules===
Daines is one of the Senate Republicans arguing in favor of the "nuclear option", "to speed up consideration of President Trump's nominees". Changing the Senate's rules to a simple majority vote would "ensure a quicker pace on Trump's court picks".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bolton|first1=Alexander|title=GOP faces internal battle over changing Senate rules|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/386233-gop-faces-internal-battle-over-changing-senate-rules|website=The Hill|accessdate=24 May 2018}}</ref>
