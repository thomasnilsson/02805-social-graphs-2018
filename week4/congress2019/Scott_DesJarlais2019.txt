====2012====
{{main|United States House of Representatives elections in Tennessee, 2012#District 4}}
By the 2012 election, the Fourth District had been significantly altered as a result of redistricting.  Notably, [[Murfreesboro, Tennessee|Murfreesboro]], formerly the heart of the 6th District, was shifted into the 4th. The redrawn 4th contains about half of the constituents who resided in the former 4th district, with 14 of 24 counties moved elsewhere.<ref>{{cite web|last=Collins |first=Michael |url=http://www.knoxnews.com/news/2012/jan/15/desjarlais-has-to-scramble-with-new-district/ |title=DesJarlais has to scramble with new district alignment » Knoxville News Sentinel |publisher=Knoxnews.com |date=October 26, 2012 |accessdate=October 30, 2012}}</ref>

DesJarlais was challenged by Democratic nominee and [[Tennessee Senate|state senator]] [[Eric Stewart (Tennessee politician)|Eric Stewart]]. For a time, it was thought that DesJarlais would face a primary challenge from state senator [[Bill Ketron]], a Murfreesboro resident and the chairman of the state senate redistricting committee, but Ketron did not run. DesJarlais defeated Stewart 56%–44%,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=705219 |title=Ourcampaigns.com |publisher=Ourcampaigns.com |date= |accessdate=August 8, 2014}}</ref><ref name="cnnelex">{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/election/2012/results/state/TN# |title=Tennessee election results |date=November 2012 |work=CNN |accessdate=November 15, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121112210952/http://www.cnn.com/election/2012/results/state/TN |archivedate=November 12, 2012 }}</ref> joining all the other incumbent members of Tennessee congressional delegation in winning reelection.<ref name="CBS election">{{cite news|url=http://www.newschannel5.com/story/20024413/desjarlais-wins-second-term-despite-scandal|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130129191227/http://www.newschannel5.com/story/20024413/desjarlais-wins-second-term-despite-scandal|dead-url=yes|archive-date=January 29, 2013|title=DesJarlais Wins Second Term Despite Scandal|date=November 7, 2012|work=NewsChannel5.com | location=Nashville|publisher=CBS|accessdate=November 10, 2012}}</ref>

Late in the 2012 campaign, more events from DesJarlais's personal life became public, making the race against Stewart "one of the ugliest Tennessee congressional races in decades".<ref name="freepress2012">{{cite news|url=http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/2012/nov/07/chattanooga-scott-desjarlais-holds-lead/|title=Scott DesJarlais holds lead (with video) |first=Andy|last=Sher|date=November 7, 2012|work=[[Chattanooga Times Free Press]]|accessdate=November 10, 2012}}</ref> In October 2012 the [[Huffington Post]] obtained a transcript of a September 2000 phone conversation in which DesJarlais pressured a mistress to get an abortion.<ref name="mcauliff">{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/10/scott-desjarlais-abortion-pro-life_n_1953136.html|publisher=huffingtonpost.com|title=Scott DesJarlais, Pro-Life Republican Congressman And Doctor, Pressured Mistress Patient To Get Abortion|date=October 10, 2012|last=McAuliff|first=Michael|accessdate=October 10, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2012/10/10/republican-rep-scott-desjarlais-pressed-mistress-to-get-an-abortion-report-says/ |title=Republican Rep.

Two weeks after DesJarlais won the 2012 election, the ''[[Chattanooga Times Free Press]]'' obtained a full transcript of DesJarlais's 2001 divorce proceedings.<ref>The state Democratic Party had fought DesJarlais's lawyers to get the documents—which ultimately ran to 679 typed pages, as transcribed from court reporters' [[shorthand]]—released, but the court ruled that it could not be entered into the public record until it was properly transcribed in its entirety.

====Formal reprimand====
In October 2012, the [[watchdog journalism|watchdog group]] [[Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington]] (CREW) requested that the Tennessee Board of Health investigate evidence that DesJarlais had had a sexual relationship with a patient, in violation of the Tennessee Medical Practice Act.<ref>{{cite news | first = Chas | last = Sisk | title = Rep.
