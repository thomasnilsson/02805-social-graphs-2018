When he entered Congress, Tonko said he wanted to focus on the issue he said he knows best – energy policy.<ref name=Almanac>{{cite web|title=Rep. Paul Tonko (D)|url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/almanac/2010/person/paul-tonko-ny/|publisher=The National Journal}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> He sponsored a bill to get $800 million research program in [[wind energy]] technologies, which would benefit [[GE Energy|GE]] in his district.

In 2010, Tonko got a provision in a House-passed bill, following the [[BP oil spill|BP disaster in the Gulf of Mexico]], to prevent future spills and help small businesses in spill research. In 2011, he sponsored an amendment seeking to protect the [[Environmental Protection Agency]]'s authority to regulate carbon emissions.<ref>[https://archive.is/20120904072256/http://www.nationaljournal.com/almanac/person/paul-tonko-ny/ ]</ref>

He is strongly against expanding the [[Bush-era tax cuts]] for high-income earners. Among other key votes, he voted for the [[Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010]],<ref>http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2010/roll638.xml</ref> [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]],<ref>http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2010/roll165.xml</ref> [[American Clean Energy and Security Act]],<ref>http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2009/roll477.xml</ref> and [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]].<ref>http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2009/roll046.xml</ref> He voted against the Republicans' budget.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/112/house/1/votes/277/ |title=GOP 2012 Budget Plan | work=The Washington Post}}</ref>

Tonko has contributed blog posts to the [[Huffington Post]], with many sharply criticizing the Republican Party, including their "budget hypocrisy" and the threat they pose to Social Security. He praised the 2011 State of the Union address, saying: "the President set out a bold agenda for our nation, an agenda that will focus on growing our economy, growing jobs, and growing opportunity for the middle class".<ref name="Response 2011">{{cite news|last=Tonko|first=Paul|title=State of the Union Response|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rep-paul-tonko/state-of-the-union-respon_b_814981.html|newspaper=The Huffington Post|date=January 27, 2011}}</ref> On numerous occasions, he has also warned of the threat that would allegedly be posed by the healthcare repeal to small businesses, to young people, and to seniors.<ref name="Tonko HuffPost">{{cite web|title=Rep.

He was actively involved in floor debates against the [[United States federal government shutdown of 2013]].
