Hurt has been a staunch opponent to the Affordable Care Act, of which he says, "The President's health care law represents a fundamental departure from the founding principles of our nation by placing more faith in government than in the American people and by inserting the federal government in between patients and their doctors." <ref name=" What they're saying about the healthcare ruling">{{cite web|url=http://www2.newsadvance.com/news/2012/jun/28/what-theyre-saying-about-healthcare-ruling-ar-2021667/|title=– Summary: What they're saying about the healthcare ruling (Lynchburg News & Advance)<!-- Bot generated title -->|publisher=|accessdate=6 May 2017}}</ref>
