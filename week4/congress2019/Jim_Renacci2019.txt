In June 2016, the [[Ohio Supreme Court]] unanimously ruled that the state of Ohio must refund $359,822 that Renacci and his wife had paid in penalties in a dispute over their 2000 taxes.

The Renaccis had relied on an earlier legal interpretation in delaying tax payments.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Eaton|first1=Sabrina|title=U.S. Rep.
