'''Robert William Bishop''' (born July 13, 1951) is the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|UT|1}}, and Chairman of the [[United States House Committee on Natural Resources|House Natural Resources Committee]] serving since 2003. He is a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].

==Early life, education, and early career==
Bishop was born in [[Kaysville, Utah|Kaysville]], [[Utah]] and graduated from [http://www.davis.k12.ut.us/Domain/7528 Davis High School]. He served as a [[Mormon missionary]] in [[Germany]] from 1970 until 1972. Bishop received a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[political science]] from the [[University of Utah]] in [[Salt Lake City]] in 1974.  He taught civics classes at [[Brigham City, Utah|Brigham City]]'s [[Box Elder High School]] from 1974 to 1980; he next taught [[German language|German]] in [[Ogden, Utah|Ogden]], Utah at [[Ben Lomond High School]]; then he returned to teaching [[government]] and [[history]] classes at Box Elder High School until his retirement from teaching in 2002.<ref name=RobBishopBio>{{cite web|title=Rob Bishop Congressional Bio|url=http://robbishop.house.gov/Biography/|archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20070530204600/http://robbishop.house.gov/Biography/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2007-05-30}}</ref> While a teacher at Box Elder, Bishop partnered with the [[Close Up Foundation]] to help students participate in Close Up's [[Washington, D.C.]] based civic education programs. He remains actively involved in the program and works to ensure that Utah students have the opportunity to visit Washington, D.C.

==Early political career==
Bishop was a member of the [[Utah House of Representatives]] from 1978 to 1994.  He was House Majority Leader and later served as Speaker of the House from 1992 until 1994.  After his retirement from the state legislature, Bishop returned to Box Elder High School and taught [[Advanced Placement|advanced placement]] courses while chairing the history department.

In 1997 he was elected chairman of the [[Utah Republican Party]], and served for two terms in this position. He has also worked as a legislative lobbyist in Washington.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
In 2002, Bishop returned to politics when he ran for the Republican nomination in the 1st District.  22-year incumbent [[James V. Hansen|Jim Hansen]] had recently announced his retirement.  At the state Republican convention, he finished first in the seven-candidate field and went on to face State Representative [[Kevin Garn]] in a primary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=217675|title=Our Campaigns - UT District 1 - R Convention Race|accessdate=7 February 2017}}</ref>  He defeated Garn in that primary with 59.8 percent of the vote, all but assuring him of being the next congressman from this heavily Republican district.<ref>{{cite web|title=Our Campaigns - UT District 1 - R Primary Race|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=27465|accessdate=7 February 2017}}</ref>  As expected, he won the general election with 61% of the vote. He has won re-election in 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010, and 2012 with even larger margins. In 2014, he was reelected with 64% of the vote.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Fahys|first1=Judy|title=Replican Bishop Returns to Congress in 1st District|url=http://kuer.org/post/republican-bishop-returns-congress-1st-district|accessdate=20 November 2014|agency=KUER 90.1|publisher=NPR|date=5 November 2014}}</ref>

===Tenure===
As a teacher, he has made education related issues a top priority. He is a strong advocate for increased local control of schools.  He opposes [[No Child Left Behind]] and supports [[school vouchers]]. He was also a co-sponsor of a proposed amendment to guarantee a balanced federal budget.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

In 2016 Bishop led drafting efforts on legislation to address the [[Puerto Rican government-debt crisis]].<ref>{{cite news |title=A New Libor Trial and Fed Leaders Onstage |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=February 6, 2017 |date=April 4, 2016 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/04/business/a-new-libor-trial-trade-data-and-fed-leaders-onstage.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Calmes |first=Jackie |title=Treasury Chief Puts a Face on Puerto Rico's Debt Crisis |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 10, 2016 |accessdate=February 6, 2017 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/10/business/dealbook/treasury-secretary-jacob-lew-puts-a-face-on-puerto-rico-debt-crisis.html}}</ref>

In the 2016 election cycle, 92.6% of contributions to Bishop's political campaign came from outside Utah, the highest out-of-state percentage of any member of the House, with much of the contributions coming from the energy and agribusiness sectors, according to an analysis by the [[Center for Responsive Politics]].<ref name=npr20170205/><ref>{{cite news |title=For campaign cash, many lawmakers use a big map; Rob Bishop nears 93 percent out-of-state |first=Emma |last=Baccellieri |date=July 8, 2016 |publisher=[[Center for Responsive Politics]] |accessdate=February 5, 2017 |url=https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2016/07/for-campaign-cash-many-lawmakers-use-a-big-map-rob-bishop-tops-the-out-of-state-list/}}</ref>

==== Federalism ====

In May 2010 Bishop joined with other conservative House members to launch the 10th Amendment Task Force.  The Task Force aims to educate Congress and the public about the concept of [[Federalism in the United States|Federalism]].{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

In 2010 Bishop introduced to the House an amendment to the [[United States Constitution]], known as the "repeal amendment,"  which would allow a majority vote of the states to overturn any act of the [[United States Congress]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Zernike |first=Kate |authorlink=Kate Zernike |title=Proposed Amendment would Enable States to Repeal Federal Law |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 20, 2010 |accessdate=February 6, 2017 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/20/us/politics/20states.html}}</ref>

==== Land use and the environment ====

Bishop supports repeal of the [[Endangered Species Act of 1973]], saying it has been "hijacked" to control land and block economic development, and that he "would love to invalidate" the law.<ref>{{cite news |title=GOP Wants to Change Endangered Species Act |date=January 17, 2017 |agency=[[Associated Press]] |publisher=[[U.S. News & World Report]] |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Environment/2017/0118/Endangered-Species-Act-get-ready-for-big-changes-says-GOP |accessdate=February 5, 2017 |first1=Matthew |first2=Matthew |last1=Brown |last2=Daly }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/c4809b5e9f4641ffa45e09b390030293|title=GOP targets landmark Endangered Species Act for big changes|work=The Big Story|access-date=2017-03-11|language=en-US}}</ref> Bishop is among those most critical of the [[Antiquities Act]].<ref name=npr20170205>{{cite news |title=Utah Representative Wants Bears Ears Gone And He Wants Trump To Do It |date=February 5, 2017 |first=Kirk |last=Siegler |authorlink=Kirk Siegler |accessdate=February 5, 2017 |url=https://www.npr.org/2017/02/05/513492389/utah-representative-wants-bears-ears-gone-and-he-wants-trump-to-do-it |publisher=[[NPR]] |work=[[Weekend Edition]]}}</ref> Bishop opposed the designation of the [[Bears Ears National Monument]] and supports repealing or shrinking the designation.<ref name=npr20170205/><ref>{{cite news |last=Davenport |first=Coral |title=Obama Designates Monuments in Nevada and Utah |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 29, 2016 |accessdate=February 5, 2017 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/28/us/politics/obama-national-monument-bears-ears-utah-gold-butte.html}}</ref> Bishop supports transferring federal public lands to the states.<ref>{{cite news |title=Congress moves to give away national lands, discounting billions in revenue |first=Heather |last=Hansman |date=January 19, 2017 |accessdate=February 5, 2017 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jan/19/bureau-land-management-federal-lease}}</ref>

From 2008–2010 Bishop served as Chairman of the [[Congressional Western Caucus]], where he advocated for multiple use of public lands and the need for fewer restrictions and mandates that limit use.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

As a Member of Congress, Bishop has introduced legislation to increase domestic energy production in the United States, such as the 3-D energy bill.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vitter.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=PressRoom.PressReleases&ContentRecord_id=0d2fa4cb-d070-30a2-9b68-20822d50d0e5|title=Vitter, Bishop Introduce Bicameral 3D Act|accessdate=5 July 2011|date=31 March 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002103740/http://vitter.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=PressRoom.PressReleases&ContentRecord_id=0d2fa4cb-d070-30a2-9b68-20822d50d0e5|archivedate=2 October 2011|df=}}</ref> Ever a proponent of [[Multiple use]] parks over single use parks, he leveraged his position as Chairman of the Subcommittee over National Parks, Forests and Public Lands to stop the Department of Interior from designating areas as new de facto wilderness areas known as Wild Lands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://robbishop.house.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=244124|title=Bishop Responds to DOI Memo Calling for a Halt on Wild Lands Designations}}{{Self-published source|date=February 2017}}</ref>

In February 2011, Bishop introduced a budget amendment<ref>{{cite web|url=http://robbishop.house.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=225394|title=Bishop Introduces Amendment to Defund National Landscape Conservation System|date=16 February 2011|accessdate=5 July 2011}}{{Self-published source|date=February 2017}}</ref> that would have defunded the [[National Landscape Conservation System]], which manages 27 million acres of [[Bureau of Land Management]] land, including the [[U.S. National Monument|National Monument]], [[National Conservation Area]], [[National Wilderness Preservation System|National Wilderness Preservation]], [[National Wild and Scenic Rivers]], [[National Scenic Trail]], [[National Historic Trail]] systems and other systems. After coming under fire for introducing this amendment,<ref>{{cite news |title=Groups blast Bishop over 'gutting' landscape conservation |first=Amy Joi |last=O'Donoghue |url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/705366847/Groups-blast-Bishop-over-gutting-landscape-conservation.html |accessdate=July 5, 2011 |date=February 16, 2011 |newspaper=[[Deseret News]]}}</ref> Bishop withdrew it.

In mid-2011, after touring of the U.S. Mexico border, Bishop supported H.R. 1505 the National Security and Federal Lands Protection Act. This bill gives the U.S. Border Patrol the authority to override specific environmental laws in order to allow the U.S. Border Patrol greater access to some of the most highly trafficked areas along the border. In addition it cedes various wilderness areas to corporations.  U.S. Border Patrol agents have cited that their efforts to address rampant criminal activity along the border have been hampered by environmental laws. The bill passed the House Natural Resources Committee and has not yet been brought before the full U.S. House of Representatives for a vote.

Bishop co-sponsored a bill put forth by House Majority whip [[Kevin McCarthy (California politician)|Kevin McCarthy]] to remove regulations from {{convert|43|e6acre|km2}} of Forest Service Roadless Areas and Wilderness Study Areas to multiple use purposes.

In 2013, Bishop announced the establishment of the Utah Public Lands Initiative.<ref name="Businesses, council respond to Public Lands Initiative">{{cite news|last=Millis|first=Kristin|title=Managing Editor|url=http://www.moabsunnews.com/news/article_d744265e-c22c-11e2-ae84-0019bb30f31a.html|accessdate=April 28, 2014|newspaper=Moab Sun News|date=May 22, 2013}}</ref> According to a staff report<ref name="PLI Staff Report">{{cite web|title=Public Lands Initiative Staff Report|url=http://robbishop.house.gov/uploadedfiles/pli_staff_report_112013.pdf|work=Staff Report|publisher=Offices of Rob Bishop, Jason Chaffetz, and Chris Stewart|accessdate=April 28, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228001854/http://robbishop.house.gov/uploadedfiles/pli_staff_report_112013.pdf|archivedate=February 28, 2014|df=}}{{Self-published source|date=February 2017}}</ref> prepared by the offices of Bishop, [[Jason Chaffetz]], and [[Chris Stewart (politician)|Chris Stewart]], the Utah Public Lands Initiative is a locally driven initiative to bring resolution to some of the most challenging land disputes in the State of Utah.  The initiative is rooted in the belief that conservation and economic development can coexist to make Utah a better place to live, work, and visit.<ref name="PLI Staff Report" />

In March 2013, Bishop sponsored the [[Fruit Height Lands Conveyance Act]] that would transfer United States Forest Service land, at no cost, to the city of Fruit Heights, Utah. The bill passed in the [[United States House of Representatives]] on June 11, 2013.

On April 10, 2013, Bishop introduced the [[Ensuring Public Involvement in the Creation of National Monuments Act]]. The bill would amend the [[Antiquities Act of 1906]] to subject [[National Monument (United States)|national monument]] declarations by the President to the [[National Environmental Policy Act of 1969]] (NEPA).<ref name=1459sum>{{cite web|title=H.R. 1459 – Summary|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/1459|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=24 March 2014}}</ref> At present, the [[President of the United States]] can unilaterally designate areas of federally-owned land as a national monument, whereas national parks and other areas are required to be enacted into law by the [[United States Congress]].<ref name=IBTjohanson>{{cite news|last=Johanson|first=Mark|title=GOP Bill Could Mean 'No More National Parks,' Public Land Advocates Warn|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/gop-bill-could-mean-no-more-national-parks-public-land-advocates-warn-1563152|accessdate=24 March 2014|newspaper=International Business Times|date=24 March 2014}}</ref> In addition to limiting the number of national monument declarations the president could make, the bill would forbid the government from declaring land belonging to a private owner as a national monument without the private owner's consent.<ref name="1459sum"/> Bishop argued that "the American people deserve the opportunity to participate in land-use decisions regardless of whether they are made in Congress or by the President". He claims his new bill would ensure "that new national monuments are created openly with consideration of public input".<ref name="IBTjohanson"/>

In February 2014 House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Doc Hastings announced that he will retire at the close of the 113th Congress.<ref name="Rep.

In January 2018, Bishop sent a letter to the founder of the clothing brand [[Patagonia (clothing)|Patagonia]] expressing his disappointment that he declined his invitation to appear before the [[United States House Committee on Natural Resources]] to discuss the corporation's position on President's Trump's actions related to the [[Bears Ears National Monument]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bishop|first1=Rob|title=Letter to Patagonia|url=https://naturalresources.house.gov/uploadedfiles/bishop_response_ltr_to_yvon.pdf|website=House Committee on Natural Resources|accessdate=7 January 2018}}</ref>
