    "### What is your dataset?\n",
    "The dataset used in this project comes from the data provided for the Yelp Dataset Challenge. This dataset consists of about 1.5 million users and about 200 thousand businesses from North America.  Additionally the dataset includes just under 6 million reviews, made by users of the Yelp service, to businesses. The businesses included in the dataset are both restaurants as well as businesses offering other services, such as postal delivery. "

    "The purpose of this project is to investigate properties of Yelp’s Elite users. For this paper, the focus will lie on Yelp’s two primary claims about their Elite users:\n",
    "\n",
    "Yelp states that its Elite users have high connectivity, which means that they are connected with many other users and interact often with members of their Yelp community. \n",
    "\n",
    "Yelp claims that its Elite users make up the “true heart of the Yelp community.” Third, Yelp claims that its users have high contribution, which means that the user has made a large impact on the site with meaningful and high-quality reviews. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first goal of our project is to analyze whether the above claims about Yelp’s Elite users are quantifiably valid. For this, we will specify several characteristics which we expect Elite users to have based on these claims. We will then perform analyses on Yelp’s dataset in order to determine whether these properties are truly represented among the Elite users. The secondary goal of our project is to find which properties are most indicative of Elite status on Yelp. \n",
    "\n",
    "The analyses for the first goal can be used for this purpose as well. This kind of information may be useful for those who are interested in becoming Elite members on Yelp. In order to become a member of the “Elite squad,” a user must go through an application process. Despite the suggestions presented above, Yelp doesn’t provide any specific criteria on exactly what characteristics a user must have to become Elite. The mystery behind the selection process for Elite users is well-documented.\n",
