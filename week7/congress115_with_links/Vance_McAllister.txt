'''Vance Michael McAllister, Sr.''' (born January 7, 1974), is a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] former member of the [[United States House of Representatives]] from [[Louisiana's 5th congressional district]]. He won a [[special election|special]] [[runoff election]] held on [[Louisiana's 5th congressional district special election, 2013|November 16, 2013]], for the seat vacated by fellow Republican [[Rodney Alexander]].

According to returns from the office of [[Louisiana Secretary of State]] [[Tom Schedler]] in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]], McAllister defeated Riser, 54,449 (59.7 percent) to 36,837 (40.3 percent), with all 981 precincts reporting.<ref name=novreturns>{{cite web|url=http://staticresults.sos.la.gov/11162013/11162013_Congressional.html|title=5th congressional district special election returns, November 16, 2013|publisher=staticresults.sos.la.gov|accessdate=November 16, 2013}}</ref> A year later, McAllister placed fourth, with 26,605 votes (11.1 percent), in a competitive primary for a full term in the U.S. House.<ref name=congelection>{{cite web|url=http://staticresults.sos.la.gov/11042014/11042014_Congressional.html|title=Election results 11/4/2014|publisher=[[Louisiana Secretary of State]]|accessdate=November 5, 2014}}</ref>

==Background==
McAllister is a lifelong resident of northeast Louisiana. He was born to Gene and Kathy McAllister in [[Oak Grove, West Carroll Parish, Louisiana|Oak Grove, Louisiana]]. The senior McAllister worked for forty-two years at the former [[International Paper Company]] mill in [[Bastrop, Louisiana|Bastrop]]. McAllister grew up on a small community in [[West Carroll Parish, Louisiana|West Carroll Parish]] and graduated in 1992 from [[Forest High School (Louisiana)|Forest High School]] in [[Forest, Louisiana]], south of Oak Grove. Immediately after high school, McAllister entered the [[United States Army]], in which he became a combat medic and served a tour of duty in [[South Korea]]. Later, he was stationed at [[Fort Knox]], [[Kentucky]].<ref name=pineywoodsj>James Ronald Skains, "Riser, McAllister placed in runoff for Congress seat", ''The Piney Woods Journal'', November 2013, pp. 1-4</ref> He subsequently joined the [[Louisiana National Guard]] and attended the [[University of Louisiana at Monroe]] but dropped out to accept employment from [[Mustang Engineering]], a company which sent him on foreign assignments. He remained affiliated with Mustang until he resigned to run for Congress.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/votevancemcallister/info|title=About Vance McAllister|publisher=[[Facebook]]|accessdate=November 3, 2013}}</ref>

==Business career==
McAllister first worked in the oilfield technology business and then branched into [[oil]] and [[natural gas]] leasing, [[real estate]], [[convenience store]]s, pipeline construction, equipment rental, and the promotion of [[wrestling]] matches and other sporting events. His most successful company is an oil exploration and production company, Texas Coastal Energy Company, based in [[Irving, Texas|Irving]]. Texas Coastal explores for oil and natural gas domestically, and is run by its CEO, Jeff Gordon. He has Fox Pizza fast-food restaurant [[Exclusive right|franchise]]s and owns three [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]] sandwich shops, two in Monroe and one in Oak Grove.<ref name=pineywoodsj/>

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===2013 election===
{{Main|Louisiana's 5th congressional district special election, 2013}}
McAllister was politically unknown until he entered the contest to choose a successor to [[Rodney Alexander]], who stepped down on September 26, 2013, in the first year of his sixth term in Congress, to join the administration of [[governor of Louisiana|Governor]] [[Bobby Jindal]] as secretary of the [[Louisiana Department of Veterans Affairs]]. With   18 percent of the vote, McAllister finished second among fourteen candidates in the first round of balloting held on October 19. State Senator [[Neil Riser]] finished first with 32 percent of the vote. In the first round of balloting, Riser led McAllister by nearly  15,000 votes and carried thirteen of the twenty-four parishes in the district.

McAllister was the leading votegetter only in West Carroll and [[Richland Parish, Louisiana|Richland]] parishes but ran a strong second to Riser in Ouachita Parish.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://staticresults.sos.la.gov/10192013/10192013_Congressional.html|title=Results for Election Date: 10/19/2013|publisher=staticresults.sos.la.gov|accessdate=November 3, 2013}}</ref> As the top two candidates, Riser and McAllister entered the runoff contest.

The catalyst for McAllister's strong showing in the race is believed in part to have been the celebrity endorsement of [[Phil Robertson]] of the ''[[Duck Dynasty]]'' [[television series]], which is filmed in [[West Monroe, Louisiana|West Monroe]]. Robertson had joked that McAllister has less political experience than Riser as a factor in McAllister's favor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2013/10/20/duck-dynasty-patron-phil-robertson-endorses-vance-mcallister-because-he-has-the-least-experience/|title=Scott Kaufman, Duck Dynasty’ patron Phil Robertson endorses Vance McAllister because he ‘has the least experience’, October 20, 2013|publisher=rawstory.com|accessdate=November 3, 2013}}</ref> 
 
Riser stressed his own experience acquired since 2008 in passing legislation, working on the Louisiana state budget, and performing constituent services,<ref name=nriser>{{cite web|url=http://www.thetowntalk.com/article/20131103/NEWS01/131102025/Neil-Riser-No-time-amateur-hour-Congress|title=Greg Hilburn, Neil Riser: No time for amateur hour in Congress|publisher=''[[The Town Talk (Alexandria)|Alexandria Daily Town Talk]]''|accessdate=November 3, 2013}}</ref> but McAllister disagrees. "Look where experience has gotten us. [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] is so disconnected from the 5th District that voters are turning their backs on the establishment," McAllister is quoted in an interview with the Monroe-based journalist Greg Hilburn.<ref name=mcall>{{cite web|url=http://www.thetowntalk.com/article/20131103/NEWS01/131102026/Vance-McAllister-Look-where-experience-has-gotten-us-|title=Vance McAllister: 'Look where experience has gotten us', November 3, 2013|work=Alexandria Daily Town Talk|accessdate=November 3, 2013}}</ref>

McAllister spent more than $400,000 of his own money in the primary campaign. "A lot of people are seeking me out now asking how I got here, more about my business and background and who I am and what I stand for. They asked why did you put your money in there. It's because there's no strings attached to me. I'm a complete outsider. I've earned everything I've [spent] in this race myself," McAllister told Hilburn. McAllister said that since the primary he has received limited funding from supporters in the runoff campaign.<ref name=mcall/> He spent an additional $400,000 in the race against Riser.<ref name=electionmessage/>

McAllister and Riser both oppose the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] signed into law in 2010 by President [[Barack H. Obama|Obama]], but the two differ on how to approach the legislation known as [[Obamacare]]. McAllister opposed the [[United States federal government shutdown of 2013]] as a proper method to force the repeal of the measure: "Obamacare is a nightmare, but it's a reality, and it's here. [We] have to live with it, we have to make it livable. We have to make it work for the people until one day we [have the votes] to repeal it."<ref name=mcall/> Riser supported the House Republicans' failed effort to de-fund the Affordable Care Act despite the temporary government shutdown. He supports a balanced budget at the national level, as is required for all the states. McAllister said that he would support a path to citizenship for individuals already in the country illegally.<ref name=mcall/> Riser, however, urged that border security be addressed before any other immigration concern. Riser endorsed the House approach of piecemeal immigration reform, rather than the comprehensive route favored by the [[U.S. Senate]].<ref name=nriser/>

Though Louisiana's congressional delegation supported Riser, McAllister won the support of the third-place special election candidate, [[Jamie Mayo]], the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[mayor]] of Monroe. Mayo said he found McAllister "more approachable" than Riser.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenewsstar.com/article/20131028/news01/310280038|title=Mayo supports more approachable McAllister|work=[[The News-Star]]|place=Monroe, LA|accessdate=October 29, 2013|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20131117071423/http://www.thenewsstar.com/article/20131028/news01/310280038/|archivedate=November 17, 2013|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Days later, McAllister garnered the endorsement of Republican [[Clyde C. Holloway]], who ran fourth in the primary, just behind Mayo.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2013/11/holloway_endorses_mcallister_a.html|title=Holloway endorses McAllister ahead of 5th Congressional District election|newspaper=Times-Picayune|accessdate=November 10, 2013|date=November 5, 2013|first=Lauren|last=McGaughy|location=New Orleans}}</ref>

On November 16, 2013, McAllister carried 14 of the 24 parishes in the district, including large margins in his home parishes of West Carroll and Ouachita as well as in [[Rapides Parish, Louisiana|Rapides]], the largest parish in Central Louisiana, [[Jackson Parish, Louisiana|Jackson]], [[Lincoln Parish, Louisiana|Lincoln]], [[Morehouse Parish, Louisiana|Morehouse]], Richland, and the African-American majority parishes, [[East Carroll Parish, Louisiana|East Carroll]], [[Madison Parish, Louisiana|Madison]], and [[Tensas Parish, Louisiana|Tensas]]. Riser fared best within his state Senate district, including his home parish of Caldwell, [[Catahoula Parish, Louisiana|Catahoula]], [[Concordia Parish, Louisiana|Concordia]], [[Franklin Parish, Louisiana|Franklin]], and [[La Salle Parish, Louisiana|La Salle]] and several of the [[Florida Parishes]] in the southeastern corner of the state.<ref name=novreturns/>

===Tenure===
On taking office, McAllister retained Alexander's congressional staff, headed by Gregory Adam Terry (born 1980), formerly of [[Harrisonburg, Louisiana|Harrisonburg]] and [[Ruston, Louisiana|Ruston]], Louisiana. McAllister's swearing-in marked his first ever trip to [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thenewsstar.com/article/20131120/NEWS01/311200030/|title=Greg Hilburn, McAllister makes first trip to D.C., November 20, 2013|work=The News-Star|accessdate=November 24, 2013}}</ref> He predicted that he would take [[Conservative (politics)|conservative]] positions most of the time, but on occasion he would vote [[Liberal (politics)|liberal]] on roll call votes. "Every incumbent ought to be a little nervous. ... The 5th District spoke and they [sic] spoke loud and clear. They see that if one of the poorest districts in the country can do it [rebut the party establishment], why wouldn't one of the most powerful districts in the country do it?", McAllister said, after he was sworn into office by [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker]] [[John Boehner]].<ref name=electionmessage>{{cite web|url=http://www.thetowntalk.com/article/20131124/NEWS01/311240010/McAllister-Election-sends-message-incumbents|title=McAllister: Election sends message to incumbents, November 24, 2013|work=Alexandria Daily Town Talk|accessdate=November 24, 2013}}</ref>  McAllister's guest at the [[2014 State of the Union Address]] was ''[[Duck Dynasty|Duck Dynasty's]]'' [[Willie Robertson]].<ref>{{cite news|newspaper = Advocate|title = McAllister seems more expendable than Vitter|first = Stephanie|last = Grace|date = 2014-04-11|page = 11B|location = Baton Rouge}}</ref>

After two months in office, McAllister told a Monroe Chamber of Commerce gathering that the job of U.S. Representative "sucks. It ain't no fun. But, the day I start enjoying it in Washington, D.C., is the day that I should come home."<ref name=monroechamber>{{cite web|url=http://www.shreveporttimes.com/article/20140124/NEWS01/301240019/U-S-Rep-Vance-McAllister-Congressional-job-sucks-|title=Barbara Leader, U.S. Rep. Vance McAllister: Congressional job 'sucks'|date=January 23, 2014|publisher=''[[The Times (Shreveport)|Shreveport Times]]''|accessdate=April 8, 2014}}</ref> McAllister said he would focus on cutting spending and serve in a "bipartisan" capacity: "People are sick and tired of government not working. Bipartisanship is necessary for government to work. All this talk about government shutdown is unnecessary."<ref name=monroechamber/>

In June 2014, the non-profit watchdog [[Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington]] requested that the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] and [[United States House Committee on Ethics|House Ethics Committee]] investigate a published statement from McAllister that an unnamed colleague had told him he would receive a $1,200 contribution from [[The Heritage Foundation]] for voting against a measure related to the [[Bureau of Land Management]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Alpert |first=Bruce |url=http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/06/watchdog_group_wants_probe_int.html |title=Watchdog group wants probe into Rep.

He also said that he had not cast the vote with the expectation of receiving money, but had revealed what was said to him to show how "money controls Washington" and how work in Congress is a "steady cycle of voting for fundraising and money instead of voting for what is right." A spokesman for The Heritage Foundation stated: "we would never do anything like that... we do not [make political donations]. The Heritage Foundation is a think tank and does research and education, but does not get involved with political bills at all."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hannapub.com/ouachitacitizen/news/local_state_headlines/article_8a017c20-ed41-11e3-b622-0017a43b2370.html|title=McAllister admits to vote for contribution|date=June 6, 2014|work=The Ouachita Citizen|accessdate=July 17, 2014}}</ref>

==Personal life==
McAllister and his wife, the former Kelly Duncan,{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} whom he married in 1997, have five children and reside in rural [[Swartz, Louisiana]].<ref name=pineywoodsj/> 
He is a member of the North Monroe [[Baptist]] Church. He describes his decision to run for Congress as a "prayerful one. Many people make light of my spiritual faith, but that is okay with me. I know the blessing that I have received from the good Lord and the inner peace that comes from being a believer. ... I knew there were a number of qualified people in the district to be congressman, but also I realized that I had the time and the financial capability ... that maybe [the others] didn't."<ref name=pineywoodsj/>

===Extramarital encounter===
On April 7, 2014, the ''[[Ouachita Citizen]]'' newspaper of [[West Monroe, Louisiana|West Monroe]], posted [[online]] a copy of a [[surveillance video]] from an [[anonymous source]] which showed McAllister kissing a woman in his Monroe district office.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://theadvocate.com/columnists/8863663-55/stephanie-grace-hypocrisy-on-mcallister|first=Stephanie|last=Grace|title=Hypocrisy on McAllister predictable|date=2014-04-13|accessdate=2014-04-15|newspaper=The Advocate|location = Baton Rouge|page=7B}}</ref> The video was recorded in McAllister's Monroe congressional office on December 23, 2013.

McAllister found himself being defended by Representative [[Cedric Richmond]], the sole [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] in Louisiana's [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House]] delegation. Richmond described McAllister's situation as one of the "gotcha moments" in which the political parties have "taken joy in the pain of their supposed opponents". U.S. Representative [[Bill Cassidy]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]–[[Baton Rouge]]) urged respect for the McAllister family's privacy and cited the [[Golden Rule]] (Matthew 7:12).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/04/post_557.html|title=Richmond reaches out to McAllister: He admonishes both parties|date=2014-04-11|accessdate=2014-04-11|newspaper=Times-Picayune|page=A3|location=New Orleans, LA|first=Bruce|last=Alpert}}</ref>

On April 11, Alexandria Republican attorney [[Ed Tarpley]], a former [[district attorney]] for [[Grant Parish, Louisiana|Grant Parish]], became McAllister's first challenger in the November 4 primary election.<ref>[[Moon Griffon|The Moon Griffon Show]]'', April 11, 2014.</ref>

On April 28, 2014, McAllister announced that he would not seek reelection. He said that his marriage and family have remained solid through the crisis and that his decision not to run for a full term had nothing to do with lack of support from Governor Jindal or Chairman Villere, who had opposed his candidacy from the beginning.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thetowntalk.com/article/20140428/NEWS01/140428008/McAllister-won-t-seek-re-election|title=Greg Hilburn, McAllister won't seek reelection, April 28, 2014|work=Alexandria Town Talk|accessdate=April 29, 2014|archive-url=https://archive.is/20140429044852/http://www.thetowntalk.com/article/20140428/NEWS01/140428008/McAllister-won-t-seek-re-election|archive-date=April 29, 2014|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}</ref> On June 30, 2014, McAllister reversed himself and announced that he was running for reelection despite his previous statement announcing his retirement.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2014/06/vance-mcallister-running-full-term-louisiana-108434.html?hp=l4|title='Kissing Congressman' Vance McAllister will run for full term|work=Politico|date=June 30, 2014|accessdate=June 30, 2014|author=Tarini Parti}}</ref>

Joining Tarpley in a challenge to McAllister was Monroe Mayor Jamie Mayo, who also ran in 2013, and the Monroe Republican Andrew Harris Brown (born June 1965), an oil and natural gas businessman and the younger son of the late state Senator [[William Denis Brown, III|William Denis "Billy" Brown, III]], also of Monroe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenewsstar.com/article/20140514/NEWS01/305140025/Monroe-businessman-Harris-Brown-to-run-for-5th-District?nclick_check=1|title=Monroe businessman Brown to run for 5th District, May 14, 2014|work=Monroe News-Star|author=Greg Hilburn|accessdate=May 15, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140516151717/http://www.thenewsstar.com/article/20140514/NEWS01/305140025/Monroe-businessman-Harris-Brown-to-run-for-5th-District?nclick_check=1|archive-date=May 16, 2014|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

A poll by the Glascock Group released in early August 2014 showed McAllister leading Mayo, 27 to 21 percent.

Dasher was followed by two other Republicans, Ed Tarpley at 9 percent and Harris Brown at 6 percent. Libertarian Party candidate Clay Grant of [[Boyce, Louisiana|Boyce]] in Rapides Parish, trailed with 5 percent. In individual match-ups with his opponents, McAllister was shown to be highly vulnerable.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenewsstar.com/article/20140805/NEWS01/308050016/McAllister-leads-5th-District-poll|title=McAllister leads 5th District poll: Democrat Monroe Mayor Mayo ranks second|work=Monroe News-Star|accessdate=August 6, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811215021/http://www.thenewsstar.com/article/20140805/NEWS01/308050016/McAllister-leads-5th-District-poll|archive-date=August 11, 2014|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Meanwhile, McAllister expressed no concern about Governor Jindal's refusal to endorse him for a full term in Congress. Instead, McAllister urged Jindal, who while speaking in [[Iowa]] dismissed the McAllister candidacy out of hand, to spend more time with his own voters in Louisiana. "Tell the governor, I said 'thank you' [for the nonendorsement]", McAllister said.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.thetowntalk.com/story/news/local/2014/08/13/mcallister-thanks-jindal-nonendorsement/13978119/|title=McAllister 'thanks' Jindal for nonendorsement|work=The Alexandria Town Talk|author=Greg Hilburn of Gannett Louisiana|date=August 12, 2014|accessdate=August 13, 2014}}</ref> McAllister had criticized Jindal for declining to expand [[Medicaid]] in Louisiana, which has a considerable population of workers unable to afford health insurance.<ref name=hardestworker/>

The Glascock Group poll released September 3 showed Dr. Abraham had taken the lead in the race with 22 percent support. McAllister was then rated a strong second with 20 percent, Jamie Mayo third at 15 percent, businessman Harris Brown fourth at 11 percent, Public Service Commissioner Clyde Holloway fifth at 9 percent, Zach Dasher sixth at 7 percent, Ed Tarpley seventh at 6 percent, and Monroe attorney Jeff Guerriero (who quickly withdrew from the race, citing the demands of his law office) and Green Party candidate Eliot Barron tied for eighth place at 4 percent each. McAllister's 20 percent poll support coincided exactly with the 20 percent who rated his congressional performance as "excellent". Another 18 percent rated McAllister "very poor".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenewsstar.com/story/news/politics/2014/09/03/abraham-jumps-mcallister-th-district-poll/15025625|title=Abraham jumps McAllister in 5th District poll|author=Greg Hilburn|date=September 3, 2014|work=The Monroe News-Star|accessdate=September 4, 2014}}</ref>

Despite what appeared to be an endorsement of McAllister in 2013, [[Phil Robertson]] withdrew his support for the congressman and instead endorsed his own nephew, Zach Dasher. Robertson said that McAllister had told him in 2013 that he stands with God and family, and "two months in he's messing with some chick." McAllister said that he was "disappointed" that 
Robertson is "speaking against the words that he writes about, like forgiveness, when we're all sinners. ... What Phil and I have in common is we believe in the same Lord, and that's the God of second chances."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shreveporttimes.com/story/opinion/2014/09/09/mcallister-becomes-target-duck-shoot/15285449/|title=McAllister becomes target of duck shoot|author=Jeremy Alford|date=September 8, 2014|work=The Shreveport Times|accessdate=September 9, 2014}}</ref>

McAllister defended his job performance and claimed to have "outworked every [other] member of Congress," having held twenty-three town hall meetings in his district in August 2014. "I know what we need in the 5th District because I listen to the people," McAlliser said.<ref name=hardestworker>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenewsstar.com/story/news/politics/2014/09/25/mcallister-outworked-every-member-congress/16222783/|title=McAllister: I've outworked every member of Congress|author=Greg Hilburn|work=Monroe News-Star|accessdate=September 26, 2014}}</ref> McAllister finished fourth in the primary election on November 4, 2014, and finished his term January 3, 2015.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

==2015 state senate race==
McAllister challenged Republican, two-term District 33 state Senator [[Mike Walsworth]] of West Monroe, in the nonpartisan blanket primary scheduled for October 24, 2015. "It's important to end the Jindal-Walsworth administration," said McAllister, a reference to Walsworth's longtime backing of Governor Jindal, a candidate for the [[U.S. presidential election, 2016|2016]] Republican presidential nomination. "They've been there eight years and we've got nothing to show for it," McAllister added.<ref name=statesenaterun>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenewsstar.com/story/news/politics/2015/09/10/mcallister-challenges-walsworth-senate-seat/72009540/|title=McAllister challenges Walsworth for Senate seat|author=Greg Hilburn|date=September 10, 2015|work=The Monroe News-Star|accessdate=September 11, 2015}}</ref>

McAllister called for debates with Walsworth in all six parishes in the district. He suggested that Walsworth plans to run for mayor of West Monroe when the long-term incumbent, Democrat [[Dave Norris (Louisiana politician)|Dave Norris]], retires: "Everybody knows he wants to run for mayor. I've seen how the state has suffered while Jindal ran for another job", McCallister said.<ref name=statesenaterun/>

Walsworth handily turned back McAllister's challenge, 15,891 votes (62.3 percent) to 9,626 (37.7 percent).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://staticresults.sos.la.gov/10242015/10242015_Legislative.html|title=Results for Election Date: 10/24/2015|publisher=Louisiana Secretary of State|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}</ref>

==Debts and Warrant for Arrest==

On September 27, 2017 a Louisiana judge issued a warrant for McAllister's arrest after he failed to appear for a debt hearing. McAllister had failed previously to appear for other debt hearings and it is claimed he owes $296,000 to one bank and $250,000 to another.<ref name=arrest>{{cite web|url=http://www.cqpolitics.com/news/politics/warrant-issued-for-former-kissing-congressman|title=Warrant Issued for Kissing Congressman|author=Eric Garcia|date=September 28, 2017|work=Roll Call|accessdate=September 28, 2017}}</ref>
