===Elections===
In 1991, State Senator Fattah decided to run for [[Pennsylvania's 2nd congressional district]] in the special election that was held after Democratic U.S. Congressman [[William H. Gray (Pennsylvania politician)|William Gray]] decided to resign. On November 5, 1991, City Councilman [[Lucien Edward Blackwell]] won the election with a plurality of 39% of the vote defeating Fattah (28%), [[John F. White, Jr.|John F. White]] (28%), and Nadine Smith-Bulford (5%).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=126365 |title=PA District 2 - Special Election Race - Nov 05, 1991 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2016-04-26}}</ref>

Fattah endorsed [[Barack Obama]] for President in 2008.<ref>[http://thehill.com/endorsements-2008.html Endorsements 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080718101229/http://thehill.com/endorsements-2008.html |date=2008-07-18 }}, ''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]''</ref>

====GEAR Up and education====
He is the architect of the [[Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs]].

In his first years in the U.S.  House of Representatives, Fattah introduced and passed into law [[Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs]] (GEAR UP), a college awareness and preparedness program. Since its inception, more than $4 billion in federal funds have been distributed to assist 12 million students in 50 states, Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, and U.S. territories.  Fattah sponsored H.R. 4207, American Dream Accounts Act which  would authorize the Department of Education to award three-year competitive grants to support partnerships that provide financial support and preparation for low-income students as they plan for their college education.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fattah Adds Financial Piece to GEAR UP|url=http://www.crewof42.com/featured/fattah-adds-financial-piece-to-gear-up/|publisher=Crew of 42}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The "Assets Effect"|url=http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/julyaugust_2012/features/the_assets_effect038418.php|publisher=The Washington Monthly}}</ref>  The bill is co-sponsored in the U. S. Senate by Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and Senator Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico. Specifically the legislation creates personal online accounts for students that monitor higher education readiness and includes a college savings account. The accounts follow students from school to school and through college. Parents can grant vested stakeholders (including counselors, teachers, coaches, mentors, and others) access to the account to update student information, monitor progress, and provide college preparatory support.

Fattah has introduced a few bills targeting the equity of resource allocation within and between school districts. In 2002, he introduced the "Student Bill of Rights", H.R. 2451.<ref>{{cite web|title=SENATOR DODD AND REPRESENTATIVE FATTAH INTRODUCE THE STUDENT BILL OF RIGHTS ACT OF 2002|url=http://www.all4ed.org/publication_material/straight_as/09092002#Rights|publisher=Alliance for Excellent Education|access-date=2012-08-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101116005625/http://all4ed.org/publication_material/straight_as/09092002#Rights|archive-date=2010-11-16|dead-url=yes|df=}}</ref>  The measure calls for States to provide highly effective teachers, early childhood education, college prep curricula and equitable instructional resources to all students who attend public schools. Current law requires that schools within the same district provide comparable educational services; this bill would extend that basic protection to the State level by requiring comparability across school districts.
 
The ESEA Fiscal Fairness Act, H.R. 5071 – amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act to requires school districts to equalize the real dollars spent among all schools within its jurisdiction – with the imperative to raise the resources allotted to schools in the poorest neighborhoods to meet those in well-off schools – before receiving federal aid.<ref>{{cite web|title=Confirming What We Knew: Poor Students Really Do Get a Raw Deal on School Funding|url=http://www.firstfocus.net/news/reading-list/confirming-what-we-knew-poor-students-really-do-get-a-raw-deal-on-school-funding|publisher=First Focus}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Diverse Groups Join Alliance to Close Loophole in Title I Comparability Provision|url=http://www.edtrust.org/dc/press-room/news/diverse-groups-join-alliance-to-close-loophole-in-title-i-comparability-provision|publisher=The Education Trust|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121209230351/http://www.edtrust.org/dc/press-room/news/diverse-groups-join-alliance-to-close-loophole-in-title-i-comparability-provision|archivedate=2012-12-09|df=}}</ref>

Fattah introduced "Communities Committed to College", H.R. 1579.<ref>{{cite web|title=Summit on Access to Higher Education Held at PhilaU|url=http://wordpress.philau.edu/today/2011/07/25/philau-hosts-summit-on-access-to-higher-education/|publisher=Philadelphia University}}</ref>  The legislation provides a 50% tax credit to donors who contribute to qualifying scholarship trusts that are recognized and registered with the [[Secretary of the Treasury]]. 
 
He also wrote the legislation for the [[American Opportunity Tax Credit]] (AOTC).  The [[tax credit]] assists any full-time college or university student or their families that claim the credit. Since 2011, it has assisted 4.5million students and their families.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} AOTC provides up to $2500 tax credit for families to assist them with the cost of college. The credit is unique in that families under a set income without a tax liability are eligible for a tax rebate. President Obama has called for making the tax credit permanent.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}
Outside of legislative work Fattah has created a few local education initiatives for Philadelphia and Pennsylvania families as a state legislator and in cooperation with state and municipal governments, including the CORE scholars program and the annual Grad Conference.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

College Opportunity Resources for Education (CORE) is an initiative providing almost $27 million in last-dollar scholarships to over 18,000 students.<ref>{{cite web|title=CORE Scholarships|url=http://www.corescholars.org/about/}}</ref>  The program encourages the students to participate in service to the local community and provides technical assistance to the families of program participants ensuring that they apply for educational assistance programs ([[Pell Grant]]s, [[PHEAA]] grants, etc.) offered by the state and federal government.
 
A report issued by the National Student Clearinghouse  concludes that participants in CORE are more likely than their fellow non-CORE classmates to complete their college education in four years.<ref>{{cite web|title=CORE Annual Report 2011|url=http://www.corescholars.org/core-scholarships-annual-report-2011/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130414142702/http://www.corescholars.org/core-scholarships-annual-report-2011/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-04-14}}</ref>

====Youth mentoring====
Fattah was the lead Democrat responsible for the funding of the [[United States Department of Justice]] and the [[United States Attorney General]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Fattah Statement at Subcommittee Markup of the FY13 Commerce, Justice, Science Appropriations Bill|url=http://democrats.appropriations.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=965&Itemid=17}}</ref>{{failed verification|date=October 2016}} Since 2011, the Congressman was able to negotiate an increase of $30M to investment in DOJ programs that fund groups including the [[Boys & Girls Clubs of America]] and [[Big Brothers Big Sisters of America]].{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

====Neuroscience====
Fattah was the lead Democrat responsible for funding some of the largest science agencies in the federal system (NASA, NSF, Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP).<ref>{{cite web|title=Committee on Appropriations- Democrats|url=http://democrats.appropriations.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=84&Itemid=17}}</ref>{{failed verification|date=October 2016}} In December 2011, Fattah through his role on the Appropriations Committee, directed the OSTP to establish an Interagency Working Group on Neuroscience (IWGN].<ref>{{cite web|title=Fattah Neuroscience Amendment Passes|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fattah-neuroscience-amendment-passes-151901895.html}}</ref>  Housed within the White House and chartered on June 20, 2012, the IWGN convenes representatives across the Federal government to make recommendations about the future of neuroscience research.
 
The Fattah Neuroscience Initiative is a policy initiative designed to make major progress understanding the human brain by intensifying, in a collaborative fashion, federal research efforts across brain disease, disorder, injury, cognition and development.<ref>{{cite web|title=FATTAH NEUROSCIENCE INITIATIVE|url=http://fattah.house.gov/index.cfm?sectionid=295&sectiontree=4,295|archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20120809110406/http://fattah.house.gov/index.cfm?sectionid%3D295%26sectiontree%3D4%2C295|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2012-08-09}}</ref> The initiative aims to coordinate Federal research across agencies and draw upon public-private partnerships and the world of academia. The initiative promotes research and discovery across brain cognition, development, disease and injury.

====Manufacturing====
Fattah states that his priority is ensuring that small and medium businesses have the tools they need to prosper in an increasingly competitive global marketplace. He is the lead Democrat responsible for funding the Department of Commerce and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} In his role on the Appropriations Committee, Fattah has advocated to $128 million in funding for the Manufacturing Extension Partnership, a program that assists small and mid-sized manufacturers create and retain jobs, increase profits, and save time and money.  He is also an advocate for the SelectUSA program, an initiative that encourages U.S. businesses operating off-shore to return to the U.S. and promote the U.S. marketplace.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fattah Speech before the Manufacturing Extension Partnership Summitt|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkRD91hRx14}}</ref>

====Cooperative development====
Fattah was considered a “true champion” of the co-op movement by the American Co-op Association.<ref>{{cite web|title=Congressman Fattah Introduces Legislation to Support and Incentivize Co-ops|url=http://www.generocity.org/congressman-fattah-introduces-legislation-to-support-and-incentivize-co-ops/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222184520/http://www.generocity.org/congressman-fattah-introduces-legislation-to-support-and-incentivize-co-ops/|archivedate=2014-02-22|df=}}</ref>

===Sponsored legislation===
As a member of Pennsylvania’s state House Fattah wrote and passed into law Pennsylvania’s Homeowners Emergency Mortgage Assistance Program (HEMAP).<ref>{{cite web|title=Homeowners' Emergency Mortgage Assistance Program (HEMAP)|url=http://www.phfa.org/consumers/homeowners/hemap.aspx|publisher=Pennsylvania Housing Finance Agency|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120816004716/http://www.phfa.org/consumers/homeowners/hemap.aspx|archivedate=2012-08-16|df=}}</ref>  HEMAP is a loan program designed to protect Pennsylvanians who, through no fault of their own, are financially unable to make their mortgage payments and are in danger of losing their homes to foreclosure. Started in 1983 by Pennsylvania’s Act 91 of 1983, it was only one of its kind until 2010 when Fattah added language to the Dodd Frank bill to provide similar assistance, to homeowners nationwide.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fattah, HUD Dep.

In 2013, Fattah served as a vice chair on the House Gun and Violence Taskforce, a taskforce created under the direction of House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi. The taskforce included both liberal and conservative Democrats, gun owners and Representatives from various cities. Fattah received an F rating from the [[National Rifle Association]] and an A+ rating from the Coalition on Gun Violence and the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence for his positions on gun control.

Since 2006, Fattah has “pioneered gun-buyback programs” in Philadelphia with the Philadelphia Police.  The program offers Philadelphians the chance to exchange firearms for vouchers for groceries or other goods.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://votesmart.org/interest-group/1564/rating/5581#.VRw46uRVK1E |title=National Rifle Association Political Victory Fund Rating - The Voter's Self Defense System |publisher=Vote Smart |date= |accessdate=2016-04-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Fattah|first=Chaka |title=Fattah cites 'no-brainer' steps for gun control |url=http://articles.philly.com/2013-03-01/news/37354747_1_universal-background-checks-gun-violence-gun-control |newspaper=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]|publisher=[[Philadelphia Media Network]], LLC |date=March 1, 2013 |accessdate=2015-07-29}}</ref>

In 2004, Fattah introduced a [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]] titled the "Transform America Transaction Fee," (H.R. 3759) which proposed to have the [[U.S. Treasury]] conduct a one-year feasibility study of a 1 percent transaction fee imposed on transactions made at any financial institution. He touted the possibility that such a system would bring in so much money it would allow for greatly increased federal spending, saying the "excess funds" would "provide universal health care, support an equitable public school finance system, and fund economic development in urban and rural areas," in addition to extinguishing the national debt and eliminating all other federal taxes.<ref>[http://www.factcheck.org/2010/09/1-transaction-tax/ 1% Transaction Tax]. ''FactCheck.org''. Retrieved on 2011-01-14.</ref> The bill died without attracting any co-sponsor. In 2005, Fattah introduced the bill again with H.R. 1601, and again in 2007 with H.R. 2130 which had a single cosponsor, Democratic Rep. [[Brian Baird]] of Washington. Both bills died without any action being taken. In 2009, Fattah introduced a fourth bill to require having a study conducted, H.R. 1703, which attracted no cosponsors. On February 23, 2010, Fattah reintroduced the bill as the "Debt Free America Act," (H.R. 4646) which proposed to repeal the federal income tax and replace it with a 1 percent "transaction tax" on every financial transaction — whether paid by cash, credit card or any form of financial transfer, the only exception being transactions involving the purchase or sale of stock.<ref>Davis, Lanny.

Retrieved on 2011-01-14.</ref> The latest bill places more focus on eliminating the federal debt. Fattah has also added a 1 percent tax credit designed to eliminate the impact of the measure on couples making less than $250,000 a year. As of September 5, 2010, none of the House committees have scheduled any action on the latest bill.

In 2005, Fattah opposed the [[War in Iraq]] and supported Congressman [[John Murtha]]'s call for troop withdrawal.<ref name=IRAQ>[http://www.pjvoice.com/v7/7300words.html An Interview with Congressman Chaka Fattah] ''The Philadelphia Jewish Voice''.</ref> He publicly supported the “Bring Our Troops Home and Iraq Sovereignty Act” a bill that called for bringing the troops home within six months and transitioning the Iraqis to self-government.

== 2007 mayoral election ==
{{main article|Philadelphia mayoral election, 2007}}

In November 2006, he declared his candidacy for [[List of mayors of Philadelphia|Mayor of Philadelphia]],<ref name="MAYOR">[http://www.philly.com/mld/philly/16048207.htm It’s official: Chaka Fattah is in the mayor’s race] Philadelphia Inquirer</ref> where two-term incumbent Mayor [[John F. Street]] was barred from re-election by [[term limit]]s, amid pressure from Democratic voters to keep his Congressional seat in order to maintain a Philadelphia representative on the powerful [[U.S. House Committee on Appropriations|Appropriations Committee in the House]]. His candidacy announcement took place next to the recently completed [[Microsoft's School of the Future|Microsoft School of the Future]] in the city's Parkside neighborhood to emphasize his campaign platform of better educational opportunities for city youth.

After emerging as a mayoral candidate, Fattah came under fire from the Philadelphia [[Fraternal Order of Police]] for his repeated calls to grant a new trial to [[Mumia Abu-Jamal]], who was convicted of murdering police officer [[Daniel Faulkner]] in 1981;<ref name="FOP">{{cite web |url=http://www.thenextmayor.com/vault/20061201mumia.html |title=Fattah draws FOP wrath over Abu-Jamal issue |accessdate=2007-01-07 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927215510/http://www.thenextmayor.com/vault/20061201mumia.html |archivedate=September 27, 2007 |df= }} The Philadelphia Daily News</ref> he also was criticized for possibly unethical campaign spending, based on new campaign finance rules adopted by the city of Philadelphia.  The Fattah campaign defended itself, claiming that it had followed less restrictive federal rules in spending the money,<ref name="CAMPAIGNFINANCE">{{cite news |url=http://www.thenextmayor.com/vault/20070209fattah_exploratory.html |title=Fattah campaign may have used 'exploratory' $ |work=The Philadelphia Inquirer |date=February 9, 2007 |via=thenextmayor.com |access-date=April 20, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927215416/http://www.thenextmayor.com/vault/20070209fattah_exploratory.html |archive-date=September 27, 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}</ref> but eventually returned a portion of the excess contributions to the [[exploratory committee]] following a settlement with the city's Board of Ethics.<ref name="CAMPAIGNFINANCE" />  Fattah eventually came in fourth in the Democratic primary, close behind fellow Congressman [[Bob Brady]] but well behind former city councilman [[Michael Nutter]], who went on to win the fall [[2007 Philadelphia Mayoral Election|general election]] handily.

==2016 indictment and conviction==

In August 2014, Fattah's longtime aide and close confidant Gregory Naylor pled guilty to federal charges in a complex money laundering scheme used to hide an illegal million-dollar loan that a candidate, unnamed in that indictment, received for his failed mayoral campaign in 2007. The loan was paid back using federal grant money intended for nonprofit organizations affiliated with Fattah.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Roebuck|first1=Jeremy|title=Former aide's guilty plea raises questions for U.S. Rep.

On July 29, 2015, Fattah and four of his associates, Bonnie Bowser, Karen Nicholas, Herbert Verderman and Robert Brand were indicted for their alleged roles in a [[racketeering]] [[Conspiracy (criminal)|conspiracy]] involving several schemes that were intended to further the political and financial interests of the defendants and others by, among other tactics, misappropriating hundreds of thousands of dollars of federal, charitable and campaign funds. The FBI further alleged that Fattah accepted an $18,000 bribe from a man seeking an ambassadorship.<ref name="fbi2015">{{cite press release |url=https://www.fbi.gov/philadelphia/press-releases/2015/congressman-chaka-fattah-and-associates-charged-with-participating-in-racketeering-conspiracy |title=Congressman Chaka Fattah and Associates Charged with Participating in Racketeering Conspiracy |publisher=[[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] |date=July 29, 2015 |accessdate=2015-07-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Roebuck|first1=Jeremy|last2=Fazlollah|first2=Mark|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/news/20150803_Fattah_case_was_built_over_years.html|title=Fattah Case Was Built Over Years|publisher=''The Philadelphia Inquirer''|date=August 3, 2015|accessdate=August 3, 2015}}</ref>

The trial was originally scheduled for May 2, 2016, but in April a judge had the date pushed back to May 16 to give the defendants time to review the excess of more than 100,000 documents accrued by the prosecution.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://6abc.com/politics/fattah-corruption-trial-testimony-pushed-back-to-may-16/1279698/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425174055/http://6abc.com/politics/fattah-corruption-trial-testimony-pushed-back-to-may-16/1279698/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2016-04-25|title=Fattah corruption trial testimony pushed back to May 16|website=6abc Philadelphia|access-date=2016-04-29|df=}}</ref>
