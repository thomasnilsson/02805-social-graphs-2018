'''Bobby Lee Rush''' (born November 23, 1946) is an American politician, civil rights leader and pastor. Rush is the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|IL|1}}, serving in Congress for more than two decades; he was first elected in 1992 and took office in 1993. He has since won consecutive re-election. The district was located principally on the [[South Side (Chicago)|South Side]] of [[Chicago]], with a population from 2003 to early 2013 that was 65% [[African-American]], a higher proportion than any other [[congressional district]] in the nation. In 2011 the [[Illinois General Assembly]] redistricted this area following the 2010 census. While still [[minority-majority]], since early 2013 it is 51.3% African American, 9.8% Latino and 2% Asian. It re-elected Rush in 2016. A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], Rush is the only politician to have defeated [[Barack Obama]] in an election, which he did in the [[Illinois's 1st congressional district election, 2000|2000 Democratic primary for Illinois' 1st congressional district]]. A civil rights activist during the 1960s, Rush became radicalized for a period and founded the Illinois chapter of the [[Black Panthers]].

==Early life, education, and activism==
Rush was born on November 23, 1946 in [[Albany, Georgia]]. After his parents separated when Rush was 7 years old, his mother took him and his siblings to [[Chicago, Illinois]], joining the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] of African Americans out of the South in the first part of the 20th century. In 1963 Rush dropped out of high school before graduating; he joined the [[U.S. Army]]. While stationed in Chicago in 1966, he joined the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]], which had helped obtain national civil rights legislation passed in 1964 and 1965. In 1968, he went [[AWOL]] from the Army and co-founded the Illinois chapter of the [[Black Panthers]]. He later finished his service, receiving an honorable discharge from the Army.

Throughout the 1960s, Rush was involved in the [[civil rights movement]] and worked in civil disobedience campaigns in the [[southern United States]]. After co-founding the Illinois chapter of the [[Black Panther Party]] in 1968, he served as its defense minister.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://projects.wsj.com/campaign2012/candidates/view/bobby-l.-rush--IL-H|title=Bobby L.

Simmonds}}</ref> Earlier that same year Rush had discussed the philosophy of his membership in the Black Panthers saying, "Black people have been on the defensive for all these years. The trend now is not to wait to be attacked. We advocate offensive violence against the power structure."<ref>{{cite news|title=A Black Panther on Little Cat Feet; Bobby Rush Drops the Clenched Fist|author=Kevin Klose|publisher=Washington Post|date=August 11, 1984}}</ref> After Hampton's death, Rush became acting chairman of the Illinois Black Panther Party.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Koziol|first1=Ronald|title=Bobby Rush Acting Chief of Panthers: Succeeds Slain Leader Hampton|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1969/12/11/page/3/article/bobby-rush-acting-chief-of-panthers|accessdate=28 July 2017|publisher=Chicago Tribune|date=December 11, 1969}}</ref>

Rush worked on several non-violent projects that built support for the Black Panthers in African-American communities, such as coordinating a medical clinic which offered [[sickle-cell anemia]] testing on an unprecedented scale.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/elections/candidate/494|title=''Washington Times'' report on Rush's sickle-cell anemia program|work=Washington Times|accessdate=November 23, 2016}}</ref> Rush's own apartment was raided in December 1969, where police discovered an unregistered pistol, rifle, shotgun, pistol ammunition, training manuals on explosives, booby traps, an assortment of communist literature, and a small amount of [[marijuana]].<ref>{{cite web|title=CBS Evening News|author=Bill Matney|publisher=CBS|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTUFIRd32FM|accessdate=November 23, 2016}}</ref> Rush was imprisoned for six months in 1972 on a weapons charge, after carrying a pistol into a police station. In 1974, he left the Panthers, who were already in decline. ''"We started glorifying thuggery and drugs"'', he told ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' magazine. Rush, a deeply religious born-again [[Christian]], said, ''"I don't repudiate any of my involvement in the Panther party—it was part of my maturing."''<ref>{{cite book|title=Almanac of American Politics|publisher=National Journal Group|accessdate=November 23, 2016}}</ref>

==Formal education==
In 1973, Rush earned his [[Bachelor of General Studies]] with honors from [[Roosevelt University]], and a [[Master's degree]] in [[political science]] from [[University of Illinois at Chicago]] in 1974. He completed a degree in [[theology|theological studies]] at [[McCormick Theological Seminary]] in 1978.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=r000515 |title=RUSH, Bobby L. - Biographical Information |website=Bioguide.congress.gov |date= |accessdate=2017-02-23}}</ref> On May 13, 2017 Rush received an Honorary Doctorate of Humanities, honoris causa, from the Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) for his outstanding contributions to Chicago.

==Politics==
===Chicago politics===
In 1974, Rush ran for a seat on the [[Chicago City Council]], the first of several black militants to seek political office, and was defeated.

In the early 1980s, however, Chicago's political life was transformed by the ascendancy of U.S. Representative [[Harold Washington]], a noted orator and a charismatic figure who helped unite the city's African-American community.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Washington was elected [[Mayor of Chicago]] in 1983, the first African American to hold the office. That same year, Rush was elected alderman from the Second Ward on Chicago's South Side. He was a part of the pro-[[Harold Washington]] faction on the Council during the "[[Council Wars]]" that began in 1983 following Washington's election as Mayor. The contest became racially polarized, with many white voters supporting a different candidate.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Rush's allies in the black-power movement abandoned the Democrats in the wake of the political turmoil that followed Washington's sudden death in 1987 and formed their own political party, naming it after the late mayor. Rush infuriated Harold Washington Party leaders by spurning their candidates for local offices and, on occasion, backing white Democrats instead. Rush worked with the regular Democrats and was rewarded with the deputy chairmanship of the state party.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Secter|first1=Bob|title=COLUMN ONE : From Scout to Panther to Politico : Bobby Rush, onetime head of the Illinois Black Panthers, is likely to be the first '60s radical leader to end up in Congress.

In [[Chicago mayoral election, 1999|1999]], Rush ran for [[Mayor of Chicago]], but lost in the Democratic primary to incumbent [[Richard M. Daley]], an ethnic [[Irish American]] whose father had long controlled the city as mayor.<ref>{{cite news|first=Ryan|last=Lizza|url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/07/21/080721fa_fact_lizza|title=Making It: How Chicago Shaped Obama|work=The New Yorker|date=July 21, 2008}}</ref> He remained active in city and regional politics.

In 2013, Rush criticized a proposal by former Republican Senator [[Mark Kirk]] who suggested that 18,000 members of the Chicago gang "Gangster Disciples" be arrested. Rush called Kirk's approach "headline grabbing", and said it was an "upper-middle-class, elitist white boy solution to a problem he knows nothing about". A spokesman for Kirk said the Congressman had dealt with the issues for decades.<ref>[http://www.jdjournal.com/2013/05/30/bobby-rush-condemns-mark-kirks-mass-gang-arrest-plan-as-elitist-white-boy-solution/ June, Daniel, "Bobby Rush Condemns Mark Kirk's Mass Gang Arrest Plan as 'Elitist White Boy Solution'"], jdjournal.com, May 30, 2013.</ref>

In 2015, Rush endorsed Mayor [[Rahm Emanuel]] in Emanuel's run-off reelection campaign against [[Jesus "Chuy" Garcia]].<ref>Bosman, Julie, [http://mobile.nytimes.com/2015/04/04/us/candidate-for-chicago-mayor-struggles-to-unite-latinos-and-blacks.html "Struggles to Unite Latinos and Blacks"], ''New York Times'', April 3, 2015.</ref>

===Endorsement of Obama for President===
Though a very close friend to former President [[Bill Clinton]] and his wife, politician [[Hillary Clinton]], Rush announced early on in the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2008|2008 Democratic primaries]] that he would support Barack Obama.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.suntimes.com/news/politics/231872,CST-NWS-obama27.article|title=Clinton pal Bobby Rush: I'm supporting Obama|date=2008-01-27|accessdate=2009-01-02|publisher=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|author=Fornek, Scott}}</ref> After Obama won the Presidency and vacated his Senate seat, Rush proposed that an African American should be appointed to fill that seat.<ref name=cpr>{{cite news|title=Rush Petitions For African-American To Replace Obama in the Senate|first=Tasha|last=Flournoy|work=Chicago Public Radio|date=December 2, 2008|url=http://www.wbez.org/Content.aspx?audioID=30530}}</ref> During a press conference, Rush said, "With the resignation of President-elect Obama, we now have no African-Americans in the [[United States Senate]], and we believe it will be a national disgrace to not have this seat filled by one of the many capable African-American Illinois politicians."<ref name=bd>{{cite news|title=Cong.

After redistricting in 1992, Rush decided to run in the newly redrawn [[Illinois' 1st congressional district]], which included much of the South Side of Chicago.

The [[Office of Congressional Ethics]] referred a matter involving Rush to the [[House Ethics Committee]] in 2014.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Skiba|first1=Katherine|title=House Ethics Committee continuing Rush investigation|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/chi-house-ethics-investigation-rush-20140725-story.html|accessdate=26 February 2017|publisher=Chicago Tribune|date=July 25, 2014}}</ref> The Office of Congressional Ethics report found he did not pay about $365,000 in rent for longtime use of an office to conduct politics.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Skiba|first1=Katherine|title=Report spells out alleged ethics misconduct by Rep.

Rush has paid family members for years in questionable practices. Rush had a family member who for years worked for his church but was paid by a campaign supporter and friend.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Neubauer|first1=Chuck|title=THE WATCHDOGS: Campaign donor paid salary of Rep.

His campaign paid his wife, Carolyn, $50,000 in 2015 for consulting, and his brother, Marlon Rush of Lansing, $13,000 in 2016 for two months' work as campaign manager, according to FEC reports.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Skiba|first1=Katherine|title=Federal Election Commission questions Rep.

Rush had personally been named in a ComEd lawsuit over the church's previous unpaid bills. Stroud was trying to break into the wireless phone industry dominated by Verizon and AT&T, and Rush was pushing for federal tax incentives that would give one of Stroud's other companies a leg up as a minority-owned business. A nonprofit Rush started got $1 million from the charitable arm of what's now AT&T for what turned out to be a failed effort to create a "technology center" in Englewood. At the time, the telecom giant was seeking support for legislation in a House committee on which Rush was a key member.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Neubauer|first1=Chuck|title=Exec seeking federal help paid $17,900 bill for Rep.

==Beloved Community Christian Church==
Rush is pastor of the Beloved Community Christian Church in the Englewood neighborhood of Chicago. Leaders of other Englewood non-profit organizations complained that the church's programs—a community development corporation Rebirth of Englewood, a public health center, and a group serving teens convicted of crimes—received an inordinate amount of government aid and weighed heavily on their own efforts for renewal.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Olivo|first1=Antonio|title=Pastor Rush stirs hope, skeptics in Englewood: Bold vision for area's rebirth draws questions|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2006-01-01/news/0601010362_1_neighborhood-build-revitalization/3|accessdate=2 March 2017|publisher=Chicago Tribune|date=January 1, 2006}}</ref>

==Unpaid taxes==
In 2013, Rush and his wife, the Beloved Community Christian Church of which Rush is pastor, and another nonprofit organization operating out of the church had tax delinquencies that added up to $195,000, and the pattern of tax delinquency was a decade old. Unpaid taxes included property taxes, income taxes, and employee withholding taxes.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Neubauer|first1=Chuck|title=No Rush to Payment|url=http://www.bettergov.org/news/no-rush-to-payment|accessdate=1 March 2017|publisher=Better Government Association|date=December 14, 2013}}</ref> New City Bank sued Rush and his wife for $500,000, claiming they failed to pay their property taxes in 2009.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Roe|first1=David|title=Bank Sues Cong.
