Prior to his election to Congress, Rigell and his wife Teri established, and continue to own, two new car dealerships under the name Freedom Automotive, one in Norfolk and the other in Chesapeake/Virginia Beach. On August 3, 2016, Rigell broke with the Republican Party establishment by becoming the first sitting member of Congress to endorse the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]] presidential candidate, [[Gary Johnson]]. Rigell had previously stated he would not vote for Republican nominee [[Donald Trump]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/07/us/politics/gary-johnson-libertarian-scott-rigell.html|title=Congressman Backs Libertarian Presidential Candidate in Campaign First|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2016-12-04}}</ref>

Rigell came under attack from his primary opponents for the dealerships he owns having sold 138 cars under the [[Cash for Clunkers]] program, which Rigell subsequently criticized as "reckless bailouts and an out-of-control federal debt." Rigell noted that buyers, not dealers, received program subsidies for trading up to a more fuel-efficient vehicle. A spokesman said that Rigell felt "an obligation to the people who work for him, and his customers."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/autos/2010-05-11-clunkers_N.htm|title=Dealers-turned-candidates run into trouble  |work=USA Today|last=Fritze|first=John|date=May 12, 2010}}</ref>  He also came under attack for making campaign contributions to [[Barack Obama]] during the [[Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2008|2008 Democratic primaries]] and to Virginia Democrat [[Louise Lucas]] in her bid against [[Randy Forbes]].<ref name="wealthy candidate"/> Rigell said he believed that [[Hillary Clinton]] would have been a worse option for President.<ref name="washingtonpostprimarypoll">{{cite news|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/virginiapolitics/2010/05/rigell_survey_says_hes_the_cle.html|title=Rigell's survey says he's the clear frontrunner in GOP race to face Rep.

;2014
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Virginia, 2014#District 2}}
Rigell was challenged by Democrat [[Suzanne Patrick]] in the general election.

Rigell said he will focus on economic issues over social issues in the 2014 election. He stated, "I wake up every day not thinking about the social issues. I sought office because I know we can do better on job creation and I'm also concerned about our fiscal trajectory." He added, "I think as part of that we're strengthening things that are important to women and, of course, to men as well. Early childhood education, making sure that our children are safe and they have great opportunities once they get out of high school or college."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Bresnahan|first1=John|title=GOP men tutored in running against women|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2013/12/gop-men-tutored-in-running-against-women-100701.html?hp=f1|accessdate=12 July 2014|publisher=Politico|date= 5 December 2013}}</ref>

Rigell announced in January 2016 that he would not run for re-election in [[United States House of Representatives elections in Virginia, 2016|2016]].<ref name="wtkr.com"/>

===Tenure and political positions===
Rigell took office in January 2011 as part of the largest Republican House majority since the 1940s.

In June 2012, Rigell was one of only two Republicans (along with [[Steven LaTourette]] of Ohio) who voted against a motion to hold Attorney General [[Eric Holder]] in [[contempt of Congress]] for his handling of the [[ATF gunwalking scandal]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://politics.nytimes.com/congress/votes/112/house/2/441 | work=The New York Times | title=Congressional Bills and Votes}}</ref> Billionaire [[Warren Buffett]] challenged the GOP that he would match any donations to the [[U.S. Treasury|Treasury]] they give. Rigell had already been giving back 15% of his salary, and when he flagged this for Buffett, Buffett agreed to match it.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://video.foxnews.com/v/1389537254001/lawmaker-calls-buffetts-bluff | work=Fox News | title=Lawmaker calls Buffett's bluff | date=April 5, 2012}}</ref>

====Social issues====
Rigell states he is "proudly pro-life",<ref>{{cite web|title=Where I Stand: Family Values|url=http://www.scottrigell.com/scott-rigell-for-family-values/|work=Scott Rigell for Congress|accessdate=November 22, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100522144146/http://www.scottrigell.com/scott-rigell-for-family-values/|archivedate=May 22, 2010|df=mdy-all}}</ref> he opposes gay marriage and opposed the repeal of "Don't Ask, Don't Tell."<ref>{{cite web|title=Scott Rigell Firmly Disagrees with Glenn Nye's Vote to Repeal Don't Ask, Don't Tell|url=http://www.scottrigell.com/press-releases/page/2/|work=Scott Rigell for Congress|accessdate=November 22, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120522013841/http://www.scottrigell.com/press-releases/page/2/|archivedate=May 22, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In 2011, Rigell cosponsored bills to prohibit abortion coverage under the national [[Affordable Health Care for America Act|Affordable Health Care]] law, prohibit the use of federal funds for [[Planned Parenthood]] and prohibit taxpayer funding of abortion.  Rigell voted for reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act.<ref>{{cite web |title=Scott Rigell On The Issues |url=http://www.ontheissues.org/VA/Scott_Rigell.htm |work=On The Issues |accessdate=November 19, 2013}}</ref> Rigell has refused to endorse Republican candidate for Lieutenant Governor [[E.W.

====Military and foreign policy====
Rigell's district includes the largest concentration of active duty and retired service members in the United States. He supported the Veterans' Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA) Act, which the House and Senate passed. This bill increased the rate of compensation for veterans who were disabled in active duty.<ref>{{cite web|title=S. 894|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=s112-894|work=GovTrack.us|publisher=Civic Impulse, LLC|accessdate=November 22, 2011}}</ref> Rigell supports the continued military effort in Afghanistan; he opposed a vote in 2011 to remove troops from the country. However, he also opposed deploying ground troops to Libya, and has joined a bipartisan coalition urging President Obama and Congress to resist "calls for a 'quick' and 'easy' military intervention in Iraq.".<ref>{{cite web|title=H Res 292|url=http://www.vote-smart.org/bill/13491/35357/121807/ground-forces-in-libya|work=National Key Votes|publisher=VoteSmart.org|accessdate=November 22, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Nichols|first1=John|title=Left-Right Coalition of 80 House Members Wants Congress to Check and Balance Iraq Intervention|url=http://www.thenation.com/blog/180524/honoring-american-experiment-bipartisan-call-restraint-iraq#|accessdate=12 July 2014|publisher=The Nation|date=3 July 2014}}</ref>

In 2011, Rigell called the President's use of force in Libya 'unconstitutional,' stating that the military action violated the War Powers Resolution of 1973 since Congress was not consulted. Rigell simultaneously introduced an amendment to the Department of Defense FY'12 Appropriations bill to defund U.S. military operations in Libya, but the amendment failed in the House.

In 2013, following an alleged chemical attack by the Assad Regime in Syria, Rigell wrote a letter to the President urging him to consult Congress, as prescribed by the War Powers Resolution, before authorizing the use of any military force overseas. He was joined by 139 Members of the House of Representatives, 21 of whom were Democrats.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rigell.house.gov/uploadedfiles/8.28.13_letter_to_potus_with_signatories.pdf |format=PDF |title=Letter From Congress to the President |website=Rigell.house.gov |accessdate=2016-12-04}}</ref>

Rigell also supported a bipartisan congressional resolution advocating for the United Nations (UN) to create a Syrian War Crimes Tribunal.<ref>{{cite news|title=Weapons plan taking shape in Syria|url=http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/national_world/2013/09/12/weapons-plan-taking-shape.html|accessdate=27 September 2017|work=[[The Columbus Dispatch]]|date=12 September 2013|language=en}}</ref> The bipartisan resolution, introduced by Representative Chris Smith of New Jersey, called for an immediate ceasefire in Syria and directed the President to work with the UN to set up a tribunal to investigate war crimes committed by both the Syrian government and rebel groups in the country.

====Budget====
Rigell supported [[Paul Ryan (politician)|Paul Ryan]]'s budget plan, [[The Path to Prosperity|Path to Prosperity]], which called for repeal of the 2010 Healthcare legislation. He vocally criticized Senate inaction on the House's budget plans in 2011, stating "Empirically we can show that the bottleneck is in the Senate – I hope every American stands up and says to Senator Reid: get these bills passed, we'll go to conference, let's work it out, we'll work weekends and get this thing moving again."<ref>{{cite web|last=Hooper|first=Molly|title=House GOP Freshman Slams Reid, Senate for Inaction on Budget|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/house/185389-house-gop-freshmen-slam-reid-senate-for-inaction-on-budget|publisher=The Hill|work=The Hill |accessdate=2013-02-04  |date=October 4, 2011 }}</ref> Ultimately, he voted in favor of S 627, the 2011 budget proposal which raised the debt ceiling and required a [[supercommittee]] to provide more concrete spending cuts.

====Opposition to Donald Trump====
During the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 2016|2016 Republican presidential primary process]], Rigell strongly opposed the candidacy of Donald Trump, writing in March 2016 that he was a "con man" and a "bully" whose potential presidency would be "reckless, embarrassing and ultimately dangerous",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pilotonline.com/news/government/politics/virginia/candidates-who-want-to-replace-rep-scott-rigell-don-t/article_9e8c9060-b594-5161-b0af-14b15f71c7c7.html |title=Candidates who want to replace Rep.

Rigell signed an August 2016 letter to the [[Republican National Committee]] from over 100 Republicans urging the RNC to suspend its support for Trump's campaign and to spend its resources on congressional Republicans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/291587-gop-lawmakers-urge-rnc-to-cut-ties-with-trump|title=GOP lawmakers urge RNC to cut ties with Trump|publisher=TheHill.com|date=2013-10-24|accessdate=2016-12-04}}</ref>
