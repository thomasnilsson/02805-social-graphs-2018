;2000s
In the 2000s, Peterson never faced a serious re-election challenge and only once did he win re-election with less than two-thirds of the vote. In 2000, he was mentioned as a possible candidate [[United States Senate election in Minnesota, 2000|for the U.S. Senate]] against Republican [[Rod Grams]], but he chose to run for re-election, winning with 69% of the vote.<ref name=snapshot>{{cite web|url=http://minnesota.publicradio.org/collections/special/2004/campaign/congress/peterson/|title=Collin Peterson|publisher=[[Minnesota Public Radio]]|date=2004|accessdate=September 13, 2014}}</ref> In 2002, he won with 65% of the vote.

;2010s
In 2010, Peterson survived another Republican wave election. This time, he defeated Lee Byberg 55%–38%, his worst election performance since 1994.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=496785 |title=MN - District 07 Race - Nov 02, 2010 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=January 15, 2012}}</ref> In [[United States House of Representatives elections in Minnesota, 2012#District 7|2012]], Peterson won re-election with 60.38% to Republican Lee Byberg's 34.85% and Independent Adam Steele's 4.67%.

In 2013, Republicans began pressuring Peterson, in hopes of convincing him to retire. His seat is one of only a handful that is represented by a Democrat but was carried by [[Mitt Romney]] in the 2012 election and is seen as a top pick-up opportunity should Peterson retire. Their tactics included airing television advertisements, hiring a press staffer to give opposition research to reporters, hiring a tracker to follow him around his district and record him, and sending [[mobile billboard]]s with critical statements on them to drive around his hometown. Peterson responded by saying "They don't have anybody else to go after. It's kind of ridiculous, but whatever."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://minnesota.publicradio.org/collections/special/columns/polinaut/archive/2013/05/gop_pokes_at_pe.shtml |title=GOP pokes at Peterson on healthcare and the IRS |publisher=MPR News |date=28 May 2013 |accessdate=10 June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/columns/on-the-trail/parties-push-for-house-retirements-20130523 |title=Parties Push For House Retirements |publisher=National Journal |date=23 May 2013 |accessdate=10 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130615183525/http://www.nationaljournal.com/columns/on-the-trail/parties-push-for-house-retirements-20130523 |archivedate=June 15, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> After Republicans spread rumors that Peterson was planning to buy a house in Florida and retire there, he said: "I went from neutral on running again to 90 percent just because of this stupid stuff they're doing.

In 1998, as part of an effort to change what were considered unequal fishing regulations between the U.S. and Canada, Peterson gained attention by proposing a [[constitutional amendment]] that would allow the residents of Minnesota's [[Northwest Angle]] to vote on whether they wanted to [[secession|secede]] from the United States and join the Canadian province of [[Manitoba]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.walrusmagazine.com/articles/2011.01-history-the-lost-canadians/ |title=The Lost Canadians |last=Stoddard |first=Grant |publisher=The Walrus |date=January–February 2011 |pages=24–31}}</ref> Peterson said that the amendment, which was part of a mock secession movement, was successful in bringing the issue to the attention of the White House: "In just the day after I introduced (the amendment), people from the vice president's office have been asking questions, people in the White House (too).

From 2003 through 2005, $14.7&nbsp;billion in crop subsidies went to the congressional districts of members on the House Committee on Agriculture, an analysis by the non-partisan Environmental Working Group found. That was 42.4% of the total subsidies. Peterson is reported to have brought $874&nbsp;million to his District.<ref>Dilanian, Ken, [https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2007-07-25-farmbill_N.htm#subsidies " Billions go to House panel members' districts"], USA Today.

The chairman says he has no problem with that. "Ten percent of the farmers produce 90% of the food," he says.

In 2004, he joined with [[Minnesota Attorney General]] [[Mike Hatch]] in suing the state of [[North Dakota]] over what they argued were discriminatory laws that forbade non-North Dakota residents from hunting during the first week of the [[waterfowl hunting]] [[Hunting season|season]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/2004/03/09_ap_huntingsuit/|title=Minnesota suing North Dakota over hunting laws|publisher=[[Minnesota Public Radio]]|author=Laura McCallum|date=March 9, 2004|accessdate=September 13, 2014}}</ref> Their case was rejected by the [[United States District Court for the District of North Dakota]], a decision which was upheld by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-8th-circuit/1144577.html|title=Minnesota Hatch v.

In January 2005, he was selected by the House Democratic Caucus to succeed former Texas Congressman [[Charlie Stenholm]] as the Ranking Member on the [[United States House Committee on Agriculture|Committee on Agriculture]].

On May 6, 2009, Peterson voiced his opposition to [[climate change]] legislation proposed by the [[Obama Administration]] saying, "I will not support any kind of climate change bill – even if you fix this – because I don't trust anybody anymore. I've had it." Peterson predicted that an [[Environmental Protection Agency]] proposal to assess indirect effects of ethanol production on greenhouse gas emissions, combined with the climate change legislation, could "kill off [[corn ethanol]]."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.feedstuffs.com/ME2/dirmod.asp?sid=F4D1A9DFCD974EAD8CD5205E15C1CB42&nm=Breaking+News&type=news&mod=News&mid=A3D60400B4204079A76C4B1B129CB433&tier=3&nid=2ED25D0552384C0396608AE0F548F8E9 |title=Peterson cries foul on EPA ethanol proposal, vows not to support climate change bill |date=May 6, 2009 |accessdate=May 7, 2009 |work=Feedstuffs |author=Sally Schuff }}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

That's why I don't do town meetings." The state Republican Party denounced the remark as "outrageous and offensive". Peterson apologized for the comment, which he described as "off-hand".<ref name="strib">{{cite web |title=Peterson apologizes for slap at constituents |first=Eric |last=Roper |url=http://www.startribune.com/local/51861647.html?elr=KArksLckD8EQDUoaEyqyP4O:DW3ckUiD3aPc:_Yyc:aUUT |date=July 29, 2009 |accessdate=July 28, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>
