==Early life, education, and business career==
Franks was born in [[Uravan, Colorado]], a [[company town]] which is now a [[ghost town]].  Franks is the son of Juanita and Edward Taylor Franks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~battle/reps/franks.htm|title=Trent Franks ancestry|website=freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com}}</ref> He was born with a [[cleft lip and palate]].  After his parents separated, Franks took care of his younger siblings. While his parents took financial responsibility, he overtook the leadership role at home.<ref name="GT">{{cite web| last =Birhanemaskel| first =Millete| title =Congressman from Arizona creates buzz in Briggsdale| publisher =Greeley Tribune| date =November 20, 2002| url =http://www.greeleytribune.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?Site=GR&Date=20021120&Category=NEWS&ArtNo=211200001&Ref=AR&SectionCat=FRONTPAGE| accessdate =March 6, 2010 }}

He moved to Arizona in 1981, where he continued to drill wells.

In 1987, he completed a course of study at the non-accredited [[National Center for Constitutional Studies]], formerly known as the Freemen Institute, in Utah.<ref>{{Cite news|author =[[Associated Press]]| title =Primaries crowded for redrawn 2nd Congressional District| newspaper =[[Kingman Daily Miner]]| date =August 12, 2002| url =https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=NaU0AAAAIBAJ&sjid=tlIDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4877,3632056&dq=trent+franks+ottawa+university&hl=en| accessdate =March 6, 2010 }}</ref> For one year, from 1989 to 1990, he attended the Arizona campus of [[Ottawa University]], based in Ottawa, Kansas.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Vote-USA.org |accessdate=September 29, 2009 |url=http://www.vote-usa.org/Intro.aspx?Id=AZFranksTrent |title=Trent Franks }}</ref>

In September 2004, Franks told ''Franchising World'' that he had been a small business owner for more than 25 years. He is one of the richest congressmen, with a reported net worth of $20+ million.<ref>{{cite journal |work=Congressman Disclosure |date=November 1, 2015 |url=http://pfds.opensecrets.org/N00006423_2014.pdf |title=U.S. Rep.

==Early political career==

===Arizona legislature===
In 1984, while working as an engineer for an oil and gas royalty-purchasing firm, Franks began his political career by running for a seat in the [[Arizona House of Representatives]], against incumbent Democrat Glenn Davis, an attorney, in District 20 in central Phoenix. Franks, who was a member of the Arizona Right to Life organization and president of the Arizona Christian Action Council, campaigned against abortion and in favor of tougher child abuse laws. He defeated Davis by 155 votes.<ref>{{cite news |work=Mohave Daily Miner |date=November 7, 1984 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=wrMOAAAAIBAJ&sjid=sYIDAAAAIBAJ&pg=7065,668571&dq=trent-franks |title=Republicans hold fast on Senate control |page=7 |publisher=UPI}}</ref> In the state legislature, Franks served as vice-chairman of the Commerce Committee and Chairman of the House Subcommittee on Child Protection and Family Preservation.

Franks was defeated in his re-election bid in November 1986.<ref>{{cite news |work=Mohave Daily Miner |date=November 5, 1986 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=z3gLAAAAIBAJ&sjid=dFMDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5983,430253&dq=trent-franks |title=Legislature results are split |page=16 |publisher=UPI}}</ref>

===Mecham administration===
In January 1987, he was appointed by Republican [[Governor of Arizona|Governor]] [[Evan Mecham]] to head the Arizona Governor's Office for Children, which is a Cabinet-level division of the Governor's office responsible for overseeing and coordinating state policy and programs for Arizona's children.

In late 1987, Franks founded the Arizona [[Family Research Institute]], a nonprofit organization affiliated with [[James Dobson]]'s [[Focus on the Family]].<ref name="Widening">{{cite news |work=Kingman Daily Miner |date=December 18, 2002 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=C4ALAAAAIBAJ&sjid=O1MDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6856,8863189&dq=trent-franks |title=Franks seeks widening of school tax credits |author=Ken Hedler}}</ref> He was the Executive Director of the organization for four and a half years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.house.gov/franks/bio_introduction.shtml |title=Extended Biography of Congressman Trent Franks |publisher=Trent Franks Congressional website |accessdate=September 29, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090901001758/http://www.house.gov/franks/bio_introduction.shtml |archivedate=September 1, 2009 |df= }}</ref>

In April 1988, after Mecham was impeached and removed from office, Franks and other appointees resigned their positions. Franks had been under investigation following an [[Associated Press]] report about his decision to spend nearly $60,000, without getting bids, for a conference at a former campaign contributor's hotel.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=e5wOAAAAIBAJ&sjid=NYEDAAAAIBAJ&pg=7072,1408752&dq=trent-franks |work=Prescott Courier |date=April 8, 1988 |title=Mecham aides quit, another will leave |agency=Associated Press |page=6A}}</ref> Later in 1988, he ran again for a legislative seat, moving to District 18 shortly before the filing deadline.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=IZAOAAAAIBAJ&sjid=WIEDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3583,2247028&dq=trent-franks |work=Prescott Courier |date= September 11, 1988 |title=Campaign called 'dirtiest' in recent memory |agency=Associated Press |page=1}}</ref> He was successful in the Republican primary but lost in the November general election.

===Political activism===
In 1992, when Franks was chairman of [[Arizonans for Common Sense]], one of the organization's efforts was a constitutional amendment on the November 1992 ballot in Arizona that banned most abortions.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=uxwOAAAAIBAJ&sjid=qH0DAAAAIBAJ&pg=2066,7041640&dq=trent-franks |work=Prescott Courier |date=June 29, 1992 |title=Abortion ruling bodes ill for Arizona |agency=Associated Press |page=1B}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |work=Miami Herald |date=July 1, 1992 |title=Politics of Abortion Likely to Inflame Elections in States |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=MH&s_site=miami&p_multi=MH&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB346F474DCA04D&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM }}</ref> The initiative lost, [[List of Arizona ballot propositions#1992|getting about 35 percent of the votes cast]].

In August 1995, [[Arizonans for an Empowered Future]], of which Franks was chairman, launched an initiative campaign to amend the state constitution, replacing the graduated state income tax with a flat 3.5 percent rate, and allowing parents to deduct the costs of private-school tuition.<ref>{{cite news |work=Kingman Daily Miner |date=August 2, 1995 |title=Arizona initiative seeks flat tax, credits for private school tuition |author=William F.

Atkins had long been very visible in the district (in contrast to her more low-key boss) to the point that many thought she was the district's representative.

{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Arizona, 2012#District 8}}
For his first five terms, Franks represented a vast district encompassing most of northwestern Arizona. While the district appeared rural, the bulk of its population was in the West Valley, which had dominated the district since it was drawn into what was then the 3rd in 1967. The district appeared to be gerrymandered because of a narrow tendril connecting the Hopi reservation to the rest of the district.  However, due to longstanding disputes between the Hopi and Navajo, it had long been believed the two tribes should be in separate districts.

However, after the 2010 census, Franks' district was renumbered as the 8th District, and reduced to essentially the [[Maricopa County]] portion of the old 2nd. As evidence of how much the West Valley had dominated the district, Franks retained 92 percent of his former constituents, even as he lost 85 percent of his old district's land.<ref>[http://www.dailykos.com/story/2011/10/04/1022899/-Arizona-Redistricting-Commission-releases-draft-map Arizona Redistricting: Commission releases draft map].

====Homeland security====
On October 14, 2009, Franks joined with three fellow Representatives in calling for the investigation of the [[Council on American-Islamic Relations]] (CAIR) over allegations of trying to plant "spies," based on a CAIR memo indicating that they "will develop national initiatives such as Lobby Day, and placing Muslim interns in Congressional offices."  The request followed publication of the book ''[[Muslim Mafia (book)|Muslim Mafia]]''. Representative [[Sue Myrick]] had written the foreword, which characterized CAIR as subversive and aligned with terrorists.<ref name=co>[http://www.charlotteobserver.com/topstories/story/1047173.html Doyle, Michael, "Judge: Controversial 'Muslim Mafia' used stolen papers"], ''[[Charlotte Observer]]'', November 10, 2009, accessed November 17, 2009{{dead link|date=March 2014}}</ref>  CAIR has countered that these initiatives are extensively used by all advocacy groups and accused Franks and his colleagues of intending to intimidate American Muslims who "take part in the political process and exercise their rights."<ref>{{cite news |publisher=Salon.com |date=October 15, 2009 |url=http://www.salon.com/opinion/greenwald/2009/10/15/investigation/index.html |title=

In September 2009, he stirred controversy when criticizing President [[Barack Obama]]. He said "Obama's first act as president of any consequence, in the middle of a financial meltdown, was to send taxpayers' money overseas to pay for the killing of unborn children in other countries. Now, I got to tell you, if a president will do that, there's almost nothing that you should be surprised at after that. We shouldn't be shocked that he does all these other insane things. A president that has lost his way that badly, that has no ability to see the image of God in these little fellow human beings, if he can't do that right, then he has no place in any station of government and we need to realize that he is an enemy of humanity."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-5350756-503544.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111107220202/http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-5350756-503544.html |archivedate=November 7, 2011 }}</ref>

====Abortion====
In a 2010 interview, discussing the legacy of [[slavery]] which Franks described as a "crushing mark on America's soul", the congressman said, "Half of all black children are aborted. Far more of the [[African American]] community is being devastated by the policies of today than were being devastated by the policies of slavery."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2010/02/26/franks_2/|title=GOP's Trent Franks: Abortion worse than slavery for blacks|author=Mike Madden|work=Salon}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=459Dny0aabI#t=5m43s |title=Representative Trent Franks |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=August 22, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/02/26/a-tip-on-slavery-holocaust-talk/ | work=The New York Times | title=A Tip on Slavery, Holocaust Talk | first=Mark | last=Leibovich | date=February 26, 2010 | accessdate=May 26, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://washingtonindependent.com/77839/trent-franks-abortion-is-worse-for-blacks-than-slavery-was |title=Trent Franks: Abortion Is Worse for Blacks Than Slavery Was " The Washington Independent |publisher=Washingtonindependent.com |date=February 26, 2010 |accessdate=August 22, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100823053640/http://washingtonindependent.com/77839/trent-franks-abortion-is-worse-for-blacks-than-slavery-was |archivedate=August 23, 2010 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Fabian |first=Jordan |url=http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/84003-goper-abortion-taking-worse-toll-on-blacks-than-slavery |title=GOPer: Abortion taking worse toll on blacks than slavery – The Hill's Blog Briefing Room |publisher=Thehill.com |date= |accessdate=August 22, 2010}}</ref>

In June 2013, he proposed a bill that would ban abortions after 20 weeks, without exceptions for [[rape]] and [[incest]]. In defense, he stirred controversy when saying that "the incidents of rape resulting in pregnancy are very low." He later clarified, "Pregnancies from rape that result in abortion after the beginning of the sixth month are very rare."<ref>[http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2013/06/12/rep-franks-tries-to-clear-up-rape-comment/?iref=allsearch.] CNN.com.

In 2017, he again proposed the same bill that would ban abortions after 20 weeks without exceptions for [[rape]] and [[incest]]. The bill passed by a vote of 237–189.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.liveaction.org/news/house-votes-ban-abortions-20-weeks/|title=BREAKING: U.S. House votes to ban abortions after 20 weeks|website=www.liveaction.org}}</ref>

Franks presided over a hearing to ban abortions after 20 weeks in the [[District of Columbia]], in which he did not allow D.C.'s lone [[Delegate (United States Congress)|delegate]] and [[Member of Congress]], Congresswoman [[Eleanor Holmes Norton]], to testify. In doing so, he said Congress has the authority to "exercise exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever" in the District, even though the heavily [[U.S. Democratic Party|Democratic]] district is strongly opposed to the ban.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/2012/05/17/gIQAAcEGXU_story.html], 2012</ref>

Franks has also been involved in the founding of a [[crisis pregnancy center]] in Tempe, Arizona, that's still in operation today.<ref name="nationalreview.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/351426/trent-franks-pro-life-warrior-katrina-trinko|title=National Review Online|author=Katrina Trinko|date=June 19, 2013|work=National Review Online}}</ref> In the past, Franks has picketed abortion clinics but has ceased to do so stating in a June 2013 interview that "It became clear to me that I could be more effective by trying to do something to light a candle rather than curse the darkness."<ref name="nationalreview.com"/>

===Sexual harassment scandal and resignation===
On December 7, 2017, the [[United States House Committee on Ethics|House Ethics Committee]] announced that it would create a special investigative subcommittee to determine if Franks had engaged in "conduct that constitutes sexual harassment and/or retaliation for opposing sexual harassment."<ref name="cnn-resign"/><ref name="WP12717">Mike DeBonis & Michelle Ye Hee Lee [https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/rep-trent-franks-of-arizona-is-expected-to-resign/2017/12/07/479d156a-db9f-11e7-b859-fb0995360725_story.html Rep. Trent Franks of Arizona, who asked staffers if they would bear his child as a surrogate, says he will resign], ''Washington Post'' (December 7, 2017).</ref> According to reports, Franks repeatedly asked at least two female staff members if they would consider serving as [[surrogacy|surrogate mothers]] for Franks and his wife,<ref name="WP12717"/> offering to compensate at least one staff member $5 million if she conceived him a child and allegedly retaliating against one of the staff members for refusing his offer.<ref name="apnews1"/> Upon being briefed on the allegations, [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] [[Paul Ryan]] found them to be "serious and requiring action" and, after confronting Franks, determined that the allegations, "which he did not deny"—warranted a referral to the House Ethics Committee. Ryan called the allegations "credible claims of misconduct."<ref name="apnews1"/>

In a statement, Franks detailed his struggle with infertility, and said, "Due to my familiarity and experience with the process of surrogacy, I clearly became insensitive as to how the discussion of such an intensely personal topic might affect others." He wrote, "I have absolutely never physically intimidated, coerced, or had, or attempted to have, any sexual contact with any member of my congressional staff," but said he would resign effective January 31, 2018, because of the "collective focus on a very important problem of justice and sexual impropriety" and he was "deeply convinced I would be unable to complete a fair House Ethics investigation before distorted and sensationalized versions of this story would put me, my family, my staff, and my noble colleagues in the House of Representatives through hyperbolized public excoriation."<ref name="statement">[https://www.politico.com/story/2017/12/07/trent-franks-statement-resignation-287128 Full text: Congressman Trent Franks statement on leaving Congress] (Politico)</ref>

The following day, Franks's wife was admitted to the hospital "due to an ongoing ailment", and Franks decided to resign effective immediately.<ref>Elizabeth Zwirz,
