=== Civil liberties ===
Connolly has voted for the [[National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012]] regarding funding the [[US Armed Forces]], including the paychecks delivered to soldiers but also including a controversial provision that allows the government and the military to detain anyone "who was part of or substantially supported al-Qaeda, the Taliban, or associated forces that are engaged in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners", and anyone who commits a "belligerent act" against the United States or its coalition allies in aid of such enemy forces, under the law of war, "without trial, until the end of the hostilities authorized by the Authorization of Use of Military Force." The law would not grant new powers to the President but it does codify federal court rulings on this issue and the detainment of [[unlawful combatant]]s until hostilities are over is in accordance to the [[Geneva Convention]]s.<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/ndaa-bill-how-did-your-congress-member-vote-384362 |title=NDAA Bill: How Did Your Congress Member Vote? |publisher=Ibtimes.com |date=2011-12-16 |accessdate=2014-08-13}}</ref><ref>112th Congress, 1st Session, H1540CR.HSE: [http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-112hr1540enr/pdf/BILLS-112hr1540enr.pdf "National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012."] pp. 265-266.</ref>

===2008===
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Virginia, 2008#District 11}}
Connolly scored a 24-point victory over his closest opponent former Congresswoman [[Leslie L. Byrne]] in the 2008 Democratic Primary. Connolly then defeated [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nominee [[Keith Fimian]] by more than ten points for the open seat held by Republican incumbent [[Thomas M. Davis|Tom Davis]].<ref name="CQPolitics">{{cite news|url=http://www.cqpolitics.com/wmspage.cfm?docID=district-VA-11|title=CQ Politics – District Detail: VA-11|publisher=CQ Politics|accessdate=February 20, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211195320/http://www.cqpolitics.com/wmspage.cfm?docID=district-VA-11|archivedate=December 11, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref>  The Independent Green Party candidate on the ballot was Joseph P. Oddo.

===2010===
{{main|Virginia's 11th congressional district election, 2010}}
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Virginia, 2010#District 11}}
Connolly was challenged again by Fimian in 2010.  Also running were Libertarian David L. Dotson, Independent Green David William Gillis, Jr., and Independent Christopher F. DeCarlo. Connolly barely survived by fewer than a thousand votes.<ref>{{cite news |title=Fimian will concede defeat to Connolly in 11th district |first=Ben |last=Pershing |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=November 8, 2010 |url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/virginiapolitics/2010/11/fimian_will_concede_defeat_to.html }}</ref>

===2012===
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Virginia, 2012#District 11}}
Connolly was challenged by Republican nominee Chris Perkins, Green nominee Joe Galdo and independent candidates Peter Marchetti, Chris DeCarlo and Mark Gibson. He received 61% of the vote.<ref>{{cite web|title=Virginia's 11th Congressional District elections, 2012|url=https://ballotpedia.org/Virginia%27s_11th_Congressional_District_elections,_2012|website=www.ballotpedia.org|accessdate=April 12, 2016}}</ref>  Connolly was significantly aided by redistricting.  The old 11th had been reckoned as a swing district, though Davis had held it without serious difficulty due to his popularity in the area.  However, redistricting made the 11th significantly more Democratic than its predecessor.  [[Barack Obama]] carried the old 11th with 57% of the vote in 2008, but would have carried it with 61% of the vote under the new lines—making it one of the most Democratic white-majority districts in the South.

===2014===
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Virginia, 2014#District 11}}

Gerry Connolly faced Republican Suzanne Scholte, Green Joe Galdo, and Libertarian Marc Harrold in his reelection bid, winning with 56.86% of the vote.<ref>{{cite web|title=Virginia's 11th Congressional District elections, 2014|url=http://ballotpedia.org/Virginia%27s_11th_Congressional_District_elections,_2014|website=www.ballotpedia.org|accessdate=October 20, 2014}}</ref>

===2016===
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Virginia, 2016#District 11}}

Connolly ran unopposed for reelection in 2016.<ref>[http://www.elections.virginia.gov/Files/CastYourBallot/CandidateList/20161108-NovGen-State-List_of_Candidates_By_Office_District.pdf COMMONWEALTH OF VIRGINIA List of Candidates]</ref><ref>[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jun/14/gop-opts-against-fielding-candidate-to-run-against/ GOP opts against fielding candidate to run against Connolly]</ref> He was reelected with 87.89% of the vote.<ref>http://results.elections.virginia.gov/vaelections/2016%20November%20General/Site/Congress.html</ref>
