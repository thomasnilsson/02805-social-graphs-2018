==Early political career==
After college, Cramer campaigned for an unsuccessful Republican tax commissioner candidate in 1984. In 1986, he campaigned for U.S. Senator [[Mark Andrews (politician)|Mark Andrews]]' bid for re-election. Andrews lost to [[North Dakota Democratic-Nonpartisan League Party]] [[U.S. Senator]] [[Kent Conrad]].

He was the Chairman of the [[North Dakota Republican Party]] from 1991 to 1993. At age 30, he was the youngest person to be named state party chairman.

In 1993, Republican Governor [[Ed Schafer]] appointed Cramer to be State Tourism Director. He served in that position until he was appointed to become Economic Development Director in 1997. In 1996, House Majority Leader [[Dick Armey]] of Texas, a North Dakota native, persuaded Cramer to challenge Democratic U.S. Congressman [[Earl Pomeroy]] in [[North Dakota's at-large congressional district]]. Pomeroy defeated him 55%–43%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=29648 |title=ND At-Large Race - Nov 05, 1996 |publisher=Our Campaigns |accessdate=2017-01-08}}</ref> In 1998, Cramer faced Pomeroy in a rematch.

In June 2018, ''The Washington Post'' reported that Cramer had contacted the White House to seek political help in his Senate campaign and that Cramer was upset that President [[Donald Trump]] had not publicly criticized incumbent Democratic Senator Heidi Heitkamp in the same way that he had criticized other Democrats.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/its-obscene-gop-candidate-seethes-as-trump-embraces-democratic-senatorsenator/2018/06/11/b8fa1f86-6b24-11e8-bf8c-f9ed2e672adf_story.html|title=‘It’s obscene’: GOP candidate seethes as Trump embraces Democratic senator|last=Sullivan|first=Sean|date=2018-06-11|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-06-12|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}</ref> Cramer later publicly criticized White House staff and argued that Trump was refraining from criticizing Heitkamp because she was a woman.<ref name=":0" /> President Trump scheduled a June 2018 trip to North Dakota to campaign for Cramer, a trip which ''Politico'' reported "could go a long way toward extinguishing tensions between the White House and the Senate hopeful."<ref>{{cite news |last1=Isenstadt |first1=Alex |title=Trump to campaign in N.

In July 2018, a spokesman for the political network organized by the [[Koch brothers]] announced that they would not financially support Cramer's campaign because the brothers viewed Cramer as insufficiently supportive of free trade and fiscal conservatism, and because Cramer held other views inconsistent with those of the Koch brothers.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Severns |first1=Maggie |title=Koch network snubs key GOP Senate candidate |url=https://www.politico.com/story/2018/07/30/koch-network-kevin-cramer-senate-749833 |accessdate=31 July 2018 |publisher=Politico |date=July 30, 2018}}</ref>

==Positions and tenure==
In February 2017, during President Trump's first address to a joint session of Congress, House Minority Leader [[Nancy Pelosi]] and a number of other female Democratic members of Congress wore white in protest against Trump. Cramer mocked the clothing protest, saying the Congresswomen dressed "poorly" and remarking, "It is a syndrome. There is no question, there is a disease associated with the notion that a bunch of women would wear bad-looking white pantsuits in solidarity with Hillary Clinton to celebrate her loss. You cannot get that weird."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2017/03/kevin-cramer-democratic-women-white-pantsuits-235578|title=GOP lawmaker: ‘Poorly dressed’ Democratic women wore ‘bad-looking white pantsuits’|work=POLITICO|access-date=2017-03-01}}</ref>
