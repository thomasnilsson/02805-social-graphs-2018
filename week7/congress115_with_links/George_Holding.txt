'''George Edward Bell Holding''' (born April 17, 1968) is an [[United States|American]] politician who is the [[United States House of Representatives|United States Representative]] for [[North Carolina's 2nd congressional district]]. He previously represented [[North Carolina's 13th congressional district|the 13th District]] from 2013 to 2017. He is a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. His district stretches from just southwest of [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]] to just east of [[Rocky Mount, North Carolina|Rocky Mount]]. He served as the [[United States Attorney]] for North Carolina's [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina|Eastern District]] from 2006 to 2011.

== Early life, education, and early law career ==
The youngest of five children, Holding grew up in [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]].  He attended the [[Groton School]] in Massachusetts.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://issuu.com/grotonschool/docs/winter-2017-quarterly/4|title=Groton School Quarterly, Winter 2017|publisher=|accessdate=19 December 2017}}</ref> He attended [[Wake Forest University]], studying Classics. After earning a Bachelor of Arts degree, he studied law at [[Wake Forest University School of Law]]. During law school, he met his future wife, Lucy Herriott. They married after graduating and returned to Raleigh where Holding practiced law with [[Kilpatrick Stockton]].<ref name="NOprofile">{{cite news|last=Beckwith |first=Ryan Teague |title=George Holding |url=http://projects.newsobserver.com/profiles/george_holding |accessdate=27 January 2012 |newspaper=Raleigh News & Observer |date=17 May 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123110609/http://projects.newsobserver.com/profiles/george_holding |archivedate=23 January 2013 |df= }}</ref>

In 1998, Holding left the practice of law to serve as legislative counsel to U.S. Senator [[Jesse Helms]] in Washington. He was employed by Maupin Taylor, a Raleigh law firm, from 2001–2002. Holding joined the U.S. Attorney's office for the Eastern District of North Carolina in 2002, working under [[Frank DeArmon Whitney]]. Under Whitney, the U.S. Attorney's office prosecuted a number of high-profile public corruption cases, including former N.C. Agriculture Commissioner [[Meg Scott Phipps]], former House Speaker [[James B. Black|Jim Black]] and former U.S. Representative [[Frank Ballance]]. Whitney left his position as U.S. Attorney when he became a judge for the [[United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina]].
 
== U.S. Attorney's office ==
In September 2006, Holding was confirmed by the [[U.S. Senate]] as Whitney's replacement. His priorities included more security in capturing child pornography and drug prosecutions. In addition, Holding prosecuted a state judge, a state Senator, a state Representative, and several sheriffs for [[political corruption]]. After [[Barack Obama]] won the presidency, Holding was asked to remain in office to complete ongoing public corruption investigations.<ref name="terrorism eight" />

When Holding left office the average sentence in drug trafficking cases in eastern North Carolina was almost twice the national average. He indicted eight defendants for conspiring to promote terrorist attacks in the United States and abroad<ref name="terrorism eight">{{cite web |url=http://www.wral.com/news/state/story/9081721/ |title=Johnston man pleads guilty in terrorist conspiracy |publisher=WRAL}}</ref> and convicted a number of child pornographers, several of whom were sentenced to more than 100 years in prison.

He worked closely with state prosecutors investigating former Governor [[Mike Easley]], who was convicted for violating state [[campaign finance]] law.<ref>{{cite news|title=Easley convicted of felony; state, federal probes end|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/2010/11/24/822886/easley-convicted-of-felony-state.html|accessdate=27 January 2012|newspaper=Raleigh News & Observer|date=24 November 2010|author=Curliss, J.

After his resignation as U.S. Attorney in 2011, Holding announced his candidacy for Congress in [[North Carolina's 13th congressional district]].<ref name="george holding candidate">{{cite news |last=Christensen |first=Rob |title=Holding will seek 13th District seat |url=http://www.newsobserver.com/2011/07/14/1342869/holding-will-seek-13th-district.html |accessdate=27 January 2012 |newspaper=Raleigh News & Observer |date=14 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716012151/http://www.newsobserver.com/2011/07/14/1342869/holding-will-seek-13th-district.html |archivedate=16 July 2011 |df= }}</ref> He was endorsed by multiple conservative business and civic leaders, including N.C. Supreme Court Chief Justice [[I. Beverly Lake]] and former U.S. Senator [[Lauch Faircloth]].

Holding won the Republican primary in May. He defeated former Raleigh Mayor [[Paul Coble]]. In the general election, he won the seat with 57% of the vote.<ref>{{cite web |last=Oleniacz |first=Laura |title=Republican Holding takes 13th District congressional seat |url=http://www.heraldsun.com/view/full_story/20735260/article-Republican-Holding-takes-13th-District-congressional-seat |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121118031551/http://www.heraldsun.com/view/full_story/20735260/article-Republican-Holding-takes-13th-District-congressional-seat |dead-url=yes |archive-date=18 November 2012 |publisher=The Herald Sun |date=7 November 2012 |accessdate=8 November 2012 |df= }}</ref>

====2014====

Holding was unopposed in the Republican primary for re-election. He won the general election against his Democratic challenger, Brenda Cleary, a registered nurse and former executive director of the North Carolina Center for Nursing, 57%-43%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://er.ncsbe.gov/?election_dt=11/04/2014&county_id=0&office=FED&contest=1165|title=NC SBE Contest Results |work=North Carolina State Board of Elections|date=4 November 2014|accessdate=18 August 2016}}</ref>

====2016====
{{Main|United States House of Representatives elections in North Carolina, 2016#District 2}}
On February 19, 2016, it was announced that as part of a court-ordered [[redistricting]], "a large chunk" of the 13th would be drawn into [[North Carolina's 2nd congressional district]]. Though Holding's home was located in the [[North Carolina's 4th congressional district|4th district]] under the new map, congressional candidates are only required to live in the state they wish to represent. Thus, Holding decided to run in the 2nd district against the incumbent, fellow Republican [[Renee Ellmers]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Campbell |first1=Colin |last2=Douglas |first2=Ann a|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/politics-columns-blogs/under-the-dome/article61330577.html|title=U.S. Rep. George Holding plans to challenge Rep. Renee Ellmers under new map|work=[[The News & Observer]]|date=19 February 2016|accessdate=18 August 2016}}</ref> Ellmers made much of the fact that Holding didn't live in the district. However, his home is just six miles from the 2nd's border, and the new district is actually geographically and demographically more his district than Ellmers'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.politifact.com/north-carolina/statements/2016/jun/03/renee-ellmers/north-carolinas-2nd-district-fight-over-residency-/|title=In North Carolina's 2nd District, a fight over residency and authenticity between Holding, Ellmers|publisher=Politifact North Carolina|date=2016-06-03}}</ref> In the primary on June 7, Holding defeated Ellmers 53%-24%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://er.ncsbe.gov/?election_dt=06/07/2016&county_id=0&office=FED&contest=1004|title=NC SBE Contest Results|work=North Carolina State Board of Elections|date=7 June 2016|accessdate=18 August 2016}}</ref>
