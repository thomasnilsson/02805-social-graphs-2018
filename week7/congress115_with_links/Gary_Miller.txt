'''Gary Gene Miller''' (born October 16, 1948) is an American politician, who was the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|CA|31}}. He was first elected in 1998 and served until 2015, when he retired. The district includes most of southern and western [[San Bernardino County, California|San Bernardino County]]. He previously represented the 42nd District from 1999 to 2013 (numbered as the 41st from 1993 to 2003). In February 2014, Miller announced he would step down at the next election.<ref>{{cite news|author=Aaron Blake|title=Rep. Gary Miller (R-Calif.) to retire|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2014/02/12/rep-gary-miller-r-calif-to-retire/|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=February 12, 2014}}</ref>

==Early life, education, and business career==
Miller was born in [[Huntsville, Arkansas]], but grew up in [[Whittier, California]].<ref>{{cite book |title=2014 Almanac of American Politics |last2=McCutcheon |first2=Chuck |last1=Barone|first1=Michael |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |year= 2013}}</ref> He attended [[Mt. San Antonio College|Mount San Antonio College]] in [[Walnut, California]], and served briefly in the [[United States Army]] in 1967 being discharged after seven weeks of boot camp at [[Fort Ord]] near [[Monterey, California|Monterey]].<ref name="harpers" />

He is a businessman who founded several companies bearing his name, including G. Miller Development, G. Miller Masonry, and G. Miller Framing. At the age of 20, he began his first company, which built single-family and custom homes. His business expanded to the development of planned communities. Miller remains active in real estate through his development company.

==Early political career (1988–1994)==

===Local politics===
Miller was appointed to the [[Diamond Bar, California]], Municipal Advisory Council in 1988. In 1989, he was elected to the city's first council that helped incorporate the city. He served as mayor in 1992.

===State Senate elections===
In 1990, he decided to run for a seat in the [[California Senate]]. Incumbent Republican State Senator [[Bill Campbell (California politician)|Bill Campbell]] of [[California's 31st State Senate district]] decided to resign. In the February 1990 special election (open primary), Miller ranked fourth, or last, among Republicans in the field, getting just 16% of the vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=554027 |title=CA State Senate 31 – Special Election Primary Race – Feb 06, 1990 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2012-04-16}}</ref>

In 1994, he decided to run for the vacant [[California's 29th State Senate district]]. In the open primary in September 1994, he ranked second among Republicans getting 21% of the vote, behind State Representative [[Dick Mountjoy]], who ranked first with 45% of the vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=698655 |title=CA State Senate 29 – Special Election Primary Race – Sep 13, 1994 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2012-04-16}}</ref>

==California Assembly (1995–1999)==

===Elections===
In 1995, Miller ran in a special election for a seat in the [[California State Assembly]] in the [[California's 60th State Assembly district|60th district]] after incumbent [[Paul Horcher]] was recalled. Miller won the open primary with 39% of the vote in a six candidate field.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=368668 |title=CA State Assembly 60 – Special Election Race – May 16, 1995 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2012-04-16}}</ref>

In 1996, he won re-election defeating Democrat Susan Amaya 53–47%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=368979 |title=CA State Assembly 60 Race – Nov 05, 1996 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2012-04-16}}</ref> He was succeeded in office by [[Bob Pacheco]].

===Committee assignments===
He was Chairman of the Assembly Budget Committee.<ref>{{cite web |last=Newlin |first=Eliza |url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/almanac/person/gary-miller-ca/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120909145105/http://www.nationaljournal.com/almanac/person/gary-miller-ca/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-09-09 |title=Rep. Gary Miller (R-CA, 42nd District) – The Almanac of American Politics |publisher=Nationaljournal.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-16 }}</ref>

==U.S. House of Representatives (1999–2015)==

===Elections===
He was elected to the U.S. House in 1998, defeating incumbent Republican and fellow Diamond Bar resident [[Jay Kim]] in the primary and then Democrat Eileen Ansari in the general election with 53 percent. He won again in 2000 with 59 percent of the vote and was re-elected in 2002 with 68 percent of the vote. In 2004, he defeated Democrat Lewis Myers with 71.5% of the vote per [https://web.archive.org/web/20080724192833/http://www.ocvote.com/live/e13/frameset.htm OCvote.com], the official county elections office website. Similarly, he won in 2008 with 63.8% of the vote, defeating Democrat Ed Chau.

For his first seven terms in Congress, Miller represented a district comprising portions of northern and eastern [[Orange County, California|Orange County]], southern [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]] and a small portion of [[San Bernardino County, California|San Bernardino County]]. After the [[2010 United States Census]], Miller's district was renumbered as the 39th District, and pushed further into Orange County, making this already strongly Republican seat even more so. The new map also placed the home of fellow Republican and 10-term incumbent [[Ed Royce]] into the 39th, setting up what would have been the only primary contest between two California Republicans. Although the 39th was more Miller's district than Royce's (Miller retained 53 percent of his former territory), Royce was considered the stronger candidate. Partly due to this, Miller announced in January 2012 that he would run in the newly created 31st District, located entirely in San Bernardino County. Miller's move effectively ended the career of [[House Rules Committee]] chairman [[David Dreier]], who had represented a large slice of the new 31st.<ref>Trygstad, Kyle. [http://www.rollcall.com/news/Gary-Miller-Switching-Districts-California-211467-1.html Gary Miller Switches California Districts to Avoid Battle With Ed Royce]. ''[[Roll Call]]'', 2012-01-12.</ref> As part of the move, he bought a second home in [[Rancho Cucamonga]], which he now claims as his official residence.

On paper, Miller faced daunting odds. He was running in a district that he had never represented before, had a sizable Democratic lean and was majority-Hispanic. Had it existed in 2008, [[Barack Obama]] would have won it with 56 percent of the vote. However, due to California's new "top-two" primary system, the three Democrats in the field split the vote, allowing Miller to come in first with only 27 percent of the vote while a fellow Republican, State Senator [[Bob Dutton]] came in second with 25 percent while three Democrats split the remaining 48 percent of the vote. In the general election, Miller defeated Dutton with 55 percent of the vote.

===Tenure===

'''Transportation and infrastructure'''

Congressman Miller was the most senior Republican from the California delegation on the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/member_info/seniority-112.pdf |title=Seniority list of the United States House of Representatives, One Hundred Twelfth Congress |publisher=Clerk of the U.S. House of Representatives |date=December 3, 2012 |accessdate=2012-12-14}}</ref> He served on the Highways and Transit; Railroads, Pipelines and Hazardous Materials; and Water Resources and Environment Subcommittees.<ref>{{cite web|title=House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure – The United States House of Representatives, One Hundred Twelfth Congress|url=http://transportation.house.gov/Default.aspx}}</ref>

In 2005, Congressman Miller secured a provision in the 2005 SAFE-TEA LU Highway Reauthorization that initiated a pilot program where 5 states, including California would assume the responsibility for conducting the federal environmental review process required by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). In California, the NEPA pilot program has shaved 17 months off of environmental review processes and 30 months off of overall project delivery.

;Streamlining regulations and review for transportation projects
During the 112th Congress, Miller introduced legislation to build off the success of the 2005 pilot program to further improve highway project delivery by eliminating bureaucratic red tape and restoring greater control to state and local governments.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c112:H.R.2538: |title=112th Congress (2011–2012) – H.R.2538 – REBUILD Act (Introduced in House – IH) |publisher=Thomas.loc.gov |date=July 14, 2011 |accessdate=2012-12-14}}</ref>

In June 2011, he introduced the Environmental Review Cooperation Act, which would make permanent a National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) pilot program that authorizes five states—including California—to take on the responsibility of complying with NEPA for Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) funded projects. The bill would also expand the program to all states that have environmental standards that are equal to or exceed federal requirements.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c112:H.R.2389: |title=112th Congress (2011–2012) – H.R.2389 – Environmental Review Cooperation Act (Introduced in House – IH) |publisher=Thomas.loc.gov |date=June 24, 2011 |accessdate=2012-12-14}}</ref>

In August 2011, Congressman Miller introduced the Breaking Down Barriers Act, which provides common sense proposals to make highway project delivery more efficient. HR 2766, The Breaking Down Barriers Act includes language that allows transportation agencies to move forward on construction activities prior to receiving grant funds, and requires prompt action by federal agencies by establishing deadlines for project approvals.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/112th-congress/house-bill/2766/text?format=txt|title=H.R.2766 - Breaking Down Barriers Act of 2011 - 112th Congress (2011-2012)|last=|first=|date=August 1, 2011|website=|publisher=Congress.gov|accessdate=2017-04-13}}</ref>

;Energy
During the 111th Congress, Congressman Miller introduced a comprehensive energy bill that would reduce regulatory burdens that delay improvements and advancements in domestic energy production. The bill would open U.S. coastal waters for drilling, allow states to share a portion of the revenue derived from such drilling, and use the earnings from offshore drilling to pay down the national debt. The legislation also included energy tax incentives for wind, solar, biodiesel, clean coal technologies and other forms of energy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/111th-congress/house-bill/3505|title=H.R.3505 - American Energy Production and Price Reduction Act - 111th Congress (2009-2010)|last=Miller|first=Gary|date=July 31, 2009|website=|publisher=Congress.gov|accessdate=2017-04-13}}</ref> Congressman Miller stated his resolution and plan to lower gas prices and work for a long term solution for the country.<ref name="garymiller.house.gov">{{cite web |url=http://garymiller.house.gov/legislativeissues/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121211215120/http://garymiller.house.gov/legislativeissues/ |archivedate=2012-12-11 |df= }}</ref>

In 2010 Miller signed a pledge sponsored by [[Americans for Prosperity]] promising to vote against any Global Warming legislation that would raise taxes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://americansforprosperity.org/files/Miller_Gary.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120612202718/http://americansforprosperity.org/files/Miller_Gary.pdf |archivedate=2012-06-12 |df= }}</ref>

;Animal welfare
During the 111th and 112th Congresses, Congressman Miller cosponsored the Puppy Uniform Protection Statute (PUPS) Act, which sets out to close loopholes in the 1966 law that allows breeders to sell puppies over the Internet without federal oversight. Specifically, this legislation requires any breeder who sells or offers to sell more than 50 dogs annually directly to the public, including over the Internet, to be licensed and inspected. The bill would also require that dogs in commercial breeding facilities have appropriate space and daily exercise.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c112:H.R.835: |title=112th Congress (2011–2012) – H.R.835 – Puppy Uniform Protection and Safety Act (Introduced in House – IH) |publisher=Thomas.loc.gov |date=February 28, 2011 |accessdate=2012-12-14}}</ref>

Congressman Miller was an original cosponsor of legislation in the 111th Congress to prohibit knowingly selling or offering to sell videos of animal crush videos in interstate or foreign commerce for commercial gain. This legislation, H.R. 5566, the Animal Crush Video Prohibition Act, was signed into law on December 9, 2010. In the 110th Congress, he sponsored the Animal Fighting Prohibition Enforcement Act, which imposes a fine and up to three years in jail for violations of the Animal Welfare Act related to sponsoring or exhibiting animals in an animal fighting venture and for buying, selling, or transporting any animal for participation in an animal fighting venture. This legislation became law on May 3, 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c110:H.R.137: |title=110th Congress (2007-2008) – Animal Fighting Prohibition Enforcement Act of 2007 |publisher=Thomas.loc.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-12-14}}</ref><!-- URL is a Thomas dab page for 5 versions of the bill because each version gets a temporary URL.

;Supporting breast cancer research
Congressman Miller cosponsored legislation supporting Breast Cancer Deadline 2020, a call to action for policymakers, researchers, breast cancer advocates, and other stakeholders to end the disease by the end of the decade. H.R. 3067 would create a commission to identify promising research, encourage partnerships between government and the private sector, and create opportunities for trans-disciplinary collaboration that may advance the mission of ending breast cancer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c112:H.R.3067: |title=112th Congress (2011–2012) – H.R.3067 – Accelerating the End of Breast Cancer Act of 2011 (Introduced in House – IH) |publisher=Thomas.loc.gov |date=September 26, 2011 |accessdate=2012-12-14}}</ref> Congressman Miller also cosponsored H.R. 466, legislation to reauthorize the sale of the Breast Cancer Stamp, with proceeds from the stamp going to the National Institute of Health to fund breast cancer research.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c112:H.R.466: |title=112th Congress (2011–2012) – H.R.466 – To amend title 39, United States Code, to extend the authority of the United States Postal Service to issue a semipostal to raise funds for breast cancer research.

During the 111th and 112th Congresses, Congressman Miller sent a letter to House Appropriations Committee requesting that appropriators include $120 million for the Department of Defense (DOD) Breast Cancer Research Program (BCRP) in defense appropriations legislation.

;Veterans
Congressman Miller supports continuing the extension of benefits to all veterans of the armed services of the United States.<ref name="garymiller.house.gov"/> During the 112th Congress, Congressman Miller cosponsored the Veteran Skills to Jobs Act, which addresses the high rate of veteran unemployment by streamlining the bureaucratic processes for veterans with relevant training to get jobs when they return home. Specifically, H.R. 4155 would direct federal agencies to view relevant military training as the equivalent of federal licensing and certification requirements.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c112:H.R.4155: |title=112th Congress (2011–2012) –  Veteran Skills to Jobs Act |publisher=Thomas.loc.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-12-14}}</ref><!-- URL is a Thomas dab page for 5 versions of the bill because each version gets a temporary URL.

Congressman Miller also cosponsored H.R. 178, legislation to repeal the so-called "Widow's Tax" and ensure military widows and families of military heroes will be fully protected. H.R. 178, also known as the Military Surviving Spouses Equity Act, would repeal current law that requires a dollar-for-dollar deduction of VA benefits for service connected deaths from military survivors' Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) annuity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c112:H.R.178: |title=112th Congress (2011–2012) – H.R.178 – Military Surviving Spouses Equity Act (Introduced in House – IH) |publisher=Thomas.loc.gov |date=January 5, 2011 |accessdate=2012-12-14}}</ref>

'''Anti-terrorism'''

In 2005, Miller cosponsored the [[Border Protection, Anti-terrorism and Illegal Immigration Control Act of 2005]] (H.R. 4437) with representative [[Jim Sensenbrenner]]. In 2006, after widespread demonstrations by immigrants, Miller wrote: "Too bad their protest didn't include giving up government-paid social services—because a day without illegal aliens would be a boon to U.S. taxpayers."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.house.gov/garymiller/CC5May2006.html | title = Capitol Connection: April 29 to May 5, 2006 | author = Gary Miller | date = 2006-05-05 | accessdate = 2007-02-06 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070205145339/http://www.house.gov/garymiller/CC5May2006.html |archivedate = 2007-02-05}}</ref>

Miller backed the development of a rail link between [[Ontario, California|Ontario]] and [[Anaheim, California|Anaheim]], part of a proposed {{convert|269|mi|km|adj=on}} line between [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] and [[Las Vegas]]. "Once completed, there would be no need for an airport in south Orange County, and the Inland Empire will reap the economic benefits as a true transportation hub," Miller said.

Miller, a history buff, become involved in the preservation of [[American Civil War|Civil War]] battlefields, after he played a bit part in the 2003 movie ''[[Gods and Generals (film)|Gods and Generals]]''.

Miller signed the [[Americans for Tax Reform|Taxpayer Protection Pledge]].<ref>[http://www.atr.org/current-taxpayer-protection-pledge-signers-th-a2851 Current Taxpayer Protection Pledge Signers] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725024055/http://www.atr.org/current-taxpayer-protection-pledge-signers-th-a2851 |date=July 25, 2011 }}</ref>

In 2011, Miller voted for the [[National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012]] as part of a controversial provision that allows the government and the military to indefinitely detain American citizens and others without trial.<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/ndaa-bill-how-did-your-congress-member-vote-384362 |title=NDAA Bill: How Did Your Congress Member Vote? |publisher=Ibtimes.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-14}}</ref>

;Allegation of sheltering profits of real estate sales
Miller sold {{convert|165|acre|km2}} to the city of [[Monrovia, California|Monrovia]], in 2002, making profit of more than $10 million. Normally, he would have had to pay state and federal taxes of up to 31% on that profit.

Miller told the [[Internal Revenue Service]] and the state of California that Monrovia had forced him to sell the property under threat of [[eminent domain]]. That allowed him to shelter the profits from capital gains taxes for more than two years before he had to reinvest the money.

Monrovia officials stated that Miller sold the land willingly and that they didn't threaten to force him to sell. A videotape of a February 2000 City Council meeting shows Miller asking city officials four times to buy his land. Another, earlier videotape confirmed Miller's position that the city had refused to let him develop the land and threatened "condemnation" of his property for public use. Although all early drafts of Monrovia's sales contract with Miller included the phrase "friendly condemnation", it was deleted when the final deal was made. Miller and his wife signed an amendment to the escrow instructions on August 1, 2002, saying, "condemnation deleted", or no longer in effect.<ref name="otb">{{cite news | url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-miller13aug13,0,2223572.story?coll=la-home-headlines | title=Official's Tax Break: on Firm Ground? | newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=2006-08-13 | first=William | last=Heisel | accessdate=2007-02-06}}</ref>

Miller took an exemption again in 2005 when he sold the 10 lots to the city of [[Fontana, California|Fontana]] and again in 2006 when he sold a building to Fontana, claiming both were compulsory sales. The lots and building had been purchased in late 2004 with proceeds from the Monrovia sale. Such exemptions gave him another two years after each sale to reinvest the funds without paying capital gains taxes.

In each case, those involved in the purchases say eminent domain was neither used nor threatened.<ref name="otb"/> On January 31, 2007, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reported that Miller's transactions are being investigated by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]].<ref name="FBIprobe">{{cite news | url = http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-miller31jan31,1,2511063.story?ctrack=1&cset=true | title = FBI probing Rep.

Miller declined to comment on the sales.<ref name="otb"/> The FBI also declined to comment. As of 2008, no investigation or legal action could be confirmed.

;2005 profits from dealings with business partner and federal transportation bill
As a member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, Miller pushed for a provision in the 2005 transportation bill that allowed the city of [[Rialto, California|Rialto]] to close its airport, the first time an act of Congress has ever shuttered an airport. It is a power the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] traditionally has had sole authority to exercise. The closing of the airport paved the way for Lewis Operating, a business partner and campaign contributor, to win a multimillion dollar contract from the city to develop the airport land and build a planned community consisting of 2,500 homes, parks and {{convert|80|acre|m2}} of retail space on the former airport and adjacent land.

Miller also helped secure $1.28 million in that bill for street improvements in front of a planned housing and retail center, including a [[Target Corporation|Target]] store that he co-owned with Lewis Operating.

Miller took out nearly $7.5 million in promissory notes in 2004 from Lewis Operating, which he used to purchase land from the company. In 2005, he sold some of that land to a part of the company, making a profit of between $1.1 million and $6 million, according to his financial disclosure report (which requires reporting a dollar range, not an exact dollar figure). The majority of the parcels that Miller bought are about two miles (3&nbsp;km) from the airport.

House Rules explicitly state that before entering into loans from an entity other than a financial institution, members of Congress and staff must submit the terms of the loans for review and a determination from the ethics committee on whether the loan is acceptable under the gift rule. It is not clear if Miller complied with this requirement.<ref name="ethics">{{cite news|url=http://www.thehill.com/thehill/export/TheHill/News/Frontpage/080906/miller.html |title=Miller may have violated House ethics rules by borrowing $7.5M |newspaper=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] |date=2006-08-09 |first=Susan |last=Crabtree |accessdate=2007-02-06 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061219042535/http://www.thehill.com/thehill/export/TheHill/News/Frontpage/080906/miller.html |archivedate=2006-12-19 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref>
