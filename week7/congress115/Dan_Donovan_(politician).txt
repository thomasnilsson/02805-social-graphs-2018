== Early life and career ==

His Irish-American father, Daniel Michael Donovan, was a longshoreman and lifelong Democrat; his Polish-American mother, Katherine Bolewicz Donovan, was a garment worker.He was raised in the Tompkinsville section of the borough. He attended Monsignor Farrell High School, an all-boys Catholic school, graduating in 1974. He went to study Criminal Justice at St. John's University. After graduating from there he attended Fordham University School of Law, earning his juris doctor in 1988.In 1989, Donovan became an Assistant District Attorney in the office of Robert M. Morgenthau. He served in the office of the New York County District Attorney under Morgenthau until 1996. Later that year Donovan became Chief of Staff to then Staten Island Borough President Guy V. Molinari. He remained in that position until 2002 when he was sworn in as Deputy Borough President of Staten Island; he had been appointed by his immediate predecessor and the then new Borough President James Molinaro.

In 2003, twenty-year incumbent Democrat William L. Murphy decided not to seek re-election. Donovan announced his intention to run to succeed him. In the election he faced Chief Assistant District Attorney David Lehr and won with over 53% of the vote. A key part of his platform was to start the county's first witness protection program, and his office led the city's prosecutors with the highest felony conviction rate in many of the years since he took office.He was re-elected in 2007 with over 68% of the vote, defeating local Democratic attorney Michael Ryan despite a last minute endorsement for his rival by longtime friend and mentor Staten Island Borough President James Molinaro; Molinaro was angered that Donovan had referred his grandson's case to a special prosecutor.Donovan's tenure as DA has seen several high-profile cases, including the second conviction of Andre Rand, long suspected in a string of kidnappings on Staten Island. In 2010, famed rapper Method Man pleaded guilty to attempted tax evasion and was forced to pay about $106,000 in restitution and penalties.

Donovan became the focus of a national controversy surrounding the death of Eric Garner in 2014 
when a Richmond County, New York grand jury declined to indict Daniel Pantaleo, the officer whose choke hold the medical examiner determined was instrumental in Garner's death, on any charges. The medical examiner had ruled Garner's death a homicide. After considering the medical examiner's findings that Garner was killed by "compression of neck (choke hold), compression of chest and prone positioning during physical restraint by police"Donovan's office declared "it is appropriate to present evidence regarding circumstances of his death to a Richmond County Grand Jury."Donovan asked the grand jury to consider whether there was "probable cause" for manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide, but did not bring forward reckless endangerment charges. After two months, the grand jury brought forward no indictment. Donovan's office strenuously opposed releasing the trial proceedings citing New York confidentiality laws despite being pressured by activists and lawmakers to release the records.


== 2010 New York Attorney General campaign ==
On May 17, 2010, Donovan, a registered Republican, announced his candidacy for the New York attorney general election, 2010, becoming the front runner for his party's nomination.

With a sixty percent win of the delegates at the convention and no primary opponent, Donovan became the presumptive nominee of the Republican Party.One week earlier, he had received the endorsement of the Conservative Party of New York but was defeated on November 2 by Democrat Eric Schneiderman.

Trump endorsed Donovan's 2018 re-election bid, but in the announcement of his endorsement mistakenly claimed that Donovan had voted for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Donovan introduced legislation that would require post offices to display Trump's portrait.


==== Health care ====
In January 2016, Donovan voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). In May 2017, he voted against the American Health Care Act (the GOP's bill repealing Obamacare).


==== Immigration ====
New York City's sole Republican member of Congress, Donovan supported President Donald Trump's 2017 executive order to impose a ban on immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries. He said, "President Trump's decision is in America's best interest, and I support exploring safe zones in the region to protect innocent life." Protesters disrupted a Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce event in February 2017, repeatedly shouting down Donovan due to his support of Trump's immigration ban.In June 2017, Donovan voted in favor of Kate's Law, which would increase penalties for undocumented immigrants that return to the United States after being deported.Donovan opposes sanctuary cities (jurisdictions that have policies in place to limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement).

==== Taxes ====
Donovan voted against the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, one of five New York Republican representatives to do so. In a statement, he shared that he opposed the bill because it would raise taxes for his constituents and additionally impact the "already unaffordable housing market in my district". With the House Ways and Means Committee being scheduled to consider legislation in September 2018 that would make permanent individual tax changes in Trump's 2017 tax law, Donovan stated he would be "forced to oppose" more tax cuts if legislation included a provision "permanently extending the $10,000 cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction".


==== Unmasking Antifa Act of 2018 ====
In 2018, Donovan introduced a bill that would penalize those who carry out actions that cause "injury, opposes, threatens or intimidates any person" while wearing a mask, with the maximum penalty being a 15 year sentence. The legislation, which made reference to the far-left group Antifa, was given media attention after being promoted by alt-right activist Mike Cernovich. Professor Mark Bray of Dartmouth said  "It's a law that threatens to clamp down on direct action politics more broadly, I think it sets a disturbing precedent."
