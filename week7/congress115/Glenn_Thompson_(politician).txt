In January 2018, Thompson voted for the Fiscal Year 2018 continuing resolution (CR), a stopgap funding bill to fund the federal government at then-current levels through February 16, 2018. It also provided for six-year funding for the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). Thompson praised the measure for delaying what he called "three onerous and unpopular Obamacare taxes, which should be permanently repealed.”

In October 2017, Thompson and Joe Courtney (D-CT) introduced H.R. 4101, the School Milk Nutrition Act of 2017, a bill to promote milk consumption by schoolchildren.


==== Food programs ====
In April 2018, Thompson supported new work and job training requirements for certain beneficiaries of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), or food stamps. Thompson spoke up for the federal Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), recalling that in the early 1980s, when he earned “less than $9,000,” he and his wife had relied upon WIC, “a short-term intervention program designed to help pregnant women and their children meet healthy nutritional needs.”


==== Gun control ====
After the Parkland, Florida, school massacre in 2018, Thompson told an audience of students that he does not agree with the idea of arming teachers and that he had voted to fund an improved national background check system. Thompson called for more "uniformed law enforcement in our schools."


==== Health care ====
In May 2017, Thompson voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) and replace it the Republican American Health Care Act.


==== Veterans ====
In April 2017, Thompson and Julia Brownley (D-CA) introduced H.R. 2123, the Veterans E-Health and Telemedicine Support (VETS) Act of 2017. In September Thompson praised the Department of Veterans Affairs for proposing a rule that was similar to his bill and that would allow VA-credentialed health care providers to practice telemedicine across state lines.Thompson sponsored the Servicemembers' Telemedicine and E-Health Portability Act of 2011, which was enacted as part of part of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012. The bill expanded the  use of telemedicine for active duty military, reserve and National Guard.


==== Environment ====
On the subject of climate change, he has said, “I think humans contribute,” but added that he was not sure of the degree to which they contribute. In September 2017, Thompson and several other Members of Congress asked the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to rescind the Waters of the United States rule, calling the regulation an overreach that expanded "EPA's authority far beyond its congressional mandate."
