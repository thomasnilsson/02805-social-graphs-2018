=== Elections ===
2008

In November 2007, Stivers announced he would run for election to Congress in Ohio's 15th District, a seat held by retiring Republican member Deborah Pryce. He won the Republican nomination and ran against Democratic Franklin County Commissioner Mary Jo Kilroy, who had nearly unseated Pryce in 2006, Libertarian Mark Noble and Independent Don Elijah Eckhart.

2012
Redistricting after the 2010 census made the 15th much friendlier to Stivers. During his first term, he represented a fairly compact district covering all of Union and Madison counties, as well as most of downtown and western Columubus. The new map, however, pushed the 15th into more rural and exurban territory south and west of the capital.

BudgetStivers has voted against raising the debt limit when there was no offset or systemic reform and supports prioritizing spending in the event that the debt limit is reached.  He was part of a proposal to add a balanced budget amendment to the US Constitution.  Stivers voted to offset the costs of disaster relief spending through discretionary budget cuts.On December 15, 2011, Stivers introduced a bill that would alter the composition of the penny, nickel, dime and quarter to steel, with a copper coat for the penny, which claimed to save an estimated $433,000,000 over the course of ten years.  The bill was referred to committee and was rejected, but Stivers has resubmitted it twice more, once in April 2013 (again rejected in committee) and again in January 2015 (once more referred to committee).  In spite of the US Mint releasing a technical report in December 2014 for its Alternative Metals Study in which it reported that steel is an unacceptable material for US coins (due to difficulty in minting, lack of security, and severe impact on both the public and the coin vending industry), Stivers kept the wording of his bill identical to the previous two versions.

He stated that "While I agree with the President that we must improve our visa vetting process in order to better protect Americans, I believe the executive order risks violating our nation's values and fails to differentiate mainstream Islamic partners from radical Islamic terrorists — setting back our fight against radical Islam. I urge the Administration to quickly replace this temporary order with permanent improvements in the visa vetting process."
Social securityStivers opposes the privatization of social security.  In addition, he also opposes raising the retirement age from its current state.
TaxesStivers took the Taxpayer Protection pledge, insuring he would not support any tax raises.  He supports a flat federal tax rate across the board for all income brackets.

In his position to support Republican congressional candidates, Stivers said his goal is to "defy history" in protecting his party's majority in the House.
