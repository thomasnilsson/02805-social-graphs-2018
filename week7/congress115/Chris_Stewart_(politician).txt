In 2014, Stewart sponsored H.R. 1422 (113th Congress), the EPA Science Advisory Board Reform Act of 2014, which would reform the composition and activities of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) science advisory board. Under the bill, at least 10% of the members of the board would be required to be from state, local, or tribal governments, and corporate and industry experts would no longer be excluded from the board and board members would be prohibited from advising the EPA in discussions that cite their work. The bill was opposed by Democrats and critics such as the Union of Concerned Scientists, who said it was enable conflicts of interests and restrict scientists' ability to provide proper advice to the government.
