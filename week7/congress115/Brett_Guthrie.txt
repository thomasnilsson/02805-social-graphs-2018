Steven Brett Guthrie (born February 18, 1964) is the U.S. Representative for Kentucky's 2nd congressional district. Located in central Kentucky, the district covers Fort Knox, Owensboro, Bowling Green and Danville. He has served in that role since 2009. He is a member of the Republican Party.

=== Elections ===
2008
In the 2008 congressional general election, he defeated his Democratic opponent, State Senator David Boswell, for the right to succeed the retiring Republican U.S. Representative Ron Lewis. Lewis announced his retirement on the last day for candidates to file for the seat in 2008, in hopes of steering the Republican nomination to his chief of staff, Daniel London. Guthrie, however, filed his papers and defeated London for the party nomination.
This set up the closest race in the 2nd in 14 years.  While Democrats have a large advantage in registration, the voters are very conservative on social issues.  This was a major reason Lewis had been able to hold on to the district with little trouble since winning it in a 1994 special election.  Ultimately, Guthrie prevailed by 15,500 votes, mostly on the strength of rural voters. Guthrie may have been boosted by voters being more motivated to come to the polls due to the Presidential election and the Senate election that were held at the same time. Republican candidate John McCain carried the district with 60 percent of the vote and won all but one county entirely within the district. The incumbent Republican Senator Mitch McConnell also carried the 2nd district easily.

2010
The 2nd reverted to form in 2010, and Guthrie defeated Democrat Ed Marksberry by a large margin.

2012
Guthrie won reelection in 2012 with over 64% of the vote.
