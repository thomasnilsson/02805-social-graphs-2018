On January 31, 2018, Dr. Marshall was a passenger on a chartered Amtrak train involved in the 2018 Republican Train Wreck. He administered first aid and CPR to the injured.


=== 2016 campaign ===
Marshall ran against incumbent Tim Huelskamp in the Republican Party primary election for Kansas's 1st congressional district in the United States House of Representatives. Marshall ran with the support of many of the state's agricultural groups, who were angered at Huelskamp losing his seat on the House Agriculture Committee, the first time in a century that a Kansan had not been on that panel.On August 2, 2016, Marshall defeated Huelskamp in the Republican primary, 56 percent to 44 percent. No Democrat even filed. In the general election, Marshall won handily, defeating independent Alan LaPolice and Libertarian Kerry Burt with 65.9 percent of the vote. However, the 1st is so heavily Republican that any Democratic challenger would have faced nearly impossible odds in any event. With a Cook Partisan Voting Index of R+24, it is the 18th most Republican district in the nation, and among districts in the Midwest, only Nebraska's 3rd congressional district is more Republican.
Marshall's candidacy was endorsed by the United States Chamber of Commerce, the Kansas Livestock Association, the National Association of Wheat Growers, and the Kansas Farm Bureau, an affiliate of the American Farm Bureau Federation.

=== Health care ===
Marshall supports repealing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Like many other Republicans who want the "health care system to rely on the free market rather than Obamacare's regulations", Marshall "measures success in how many people can afford to leave the Medicaid program and enter the private insurance market." In opposing the Act's Medicaid expansion, Marshall said in an interview in March 2017, "Just, like, homeless people... I think just morally, spiritually, socially, (some people) just don't want health care. The Medicaid population, which is [on] a free credit card, as a group, do probably the least preventive medicine and taking care of themselves and eating healthy and exercising. And I'm not judging, I'm just saying socially that's where they are. So there's a group of people that even with unlimited access to health care are only going to use the emergency room when their arm is chopped off or when their pneumonia is so bad they get brought [into] the ER." Those who support Medicaid, say that Marshall did not understand how Kansas Medicaid operates. The program provides "medical coverage for low-income families and disabled Kansans". Marshall's remark attracted widespread attention and criticism.

==== Subsidies ====
Marshall, who is represents a rural district, supports farm subsidies, such as federal crop insurance. Marshall's support for subsidies gained him the 2016 endorsement of the Kansas Farm Bureau (KFB) in the Republican primary, in which he prevailed over Representative Tim Huelskamp. The KFB opposed Huelskamp's own opposition to some farm subsidies.

Marshall opposes tax increases on any tax bracket.

Marshall supported President Donald Trump's Executive Order 13769, which barred the nationals of seven Muslim-majority nations from entering the United States. However, Marshall supports an immigration bill with a pathway to citizenship for people not living in the US legally; such legislation is supported by the agriculture lobby, which is powerful in Marshall's district.


=== Social issues ===

Marshall is anti-abortion.


==== Cannabis ====
Marshall is not "convinced" that medical marijuana is safe and provides medicinal benefits. In early 2017, he stated "I'm not convinced yet so I'm going to be very cautious," regarding the legalization of medical marijuana, "I think there's a path there, but I just haven't seen enough scientific data to say it's a good thing,"
