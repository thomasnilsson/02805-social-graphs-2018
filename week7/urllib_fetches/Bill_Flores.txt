=== 2010 election ===

In late 2009 Flores entered the Republican primary for the 17th District, held by 10-term Democratic incumbent Chet Edwards. Flores claimed his worries about the future of "the American dream" inspired him to run for Congress. He committed a half million dollars of his own money to self-fund his campaign.In the Republican primary runoff on April 13, he had defeated Rob Curnock by a 64–36 percent margin. The size of his primary victory was a surprise to many political observers because Curnock was the 2008 nominee and he held Edwards' 2008 vote total close to 50 percent, despite being heavily outspent. During the Republican primary, Flores received the endorsement of former Republican U.S. Senator Phil Gramm  After the primary win, Flores was also endorsed by George H.W. Bush, John McCain, Mitt Romney, and Mike Huckabee.Through December 21, 2010, Flores' campaign raised $3.5 million, of which $1.49 million came from Flores himself. He spent $3.3 million overall.On November 2, 2010, Flores defeated Edwards with 62 percent of the vote.  This was the largest margin of defeat for a Democratic incumbent in the 2010 cycle.Flores won his fourth term in the U.S. House in the general election held on November 8, 2016. With 149,417 votes (60.8 percent), he defeated the Democrat William Matta, who trailed with 86,603 ballots (35.2 percent) and the Libertarian Clark Patterson with 9,708 (4 percent).
