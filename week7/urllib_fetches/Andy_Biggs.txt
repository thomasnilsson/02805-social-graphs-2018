In 2017, he received a 30% rating from NARAL Pro-Choice America.

Instead, we should allow the free market to expand the internet and its services."  Biggs, incidentally, has accepted campaign donations in the past in the amount of $19,500 from the same members of the Telecom industry that stand to profit from the elimination of Net Neutrality guidelines.
