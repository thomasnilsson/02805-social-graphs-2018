== Elections to the House of Representatives ==


=== Special election (2001) ===
After his father, Republican U.S. Congressman Bud Shuster, resigned from congress in January 2001 following a strong rebuke from the House ethics committee, Bill Shuster ran for Pennsylvania's 9th congressional district. On February 18, 2001, he won the Republican nomination with 59% of the vote, defeating State Representative Patrick Fleagle (32%) and Blair County Commissioner John Eichelberger (9%). On May 15, 2001, Shuster won the special election, defeating Democratic Centre County Commissioner Scott Conklin 52%–44%. Shuster won nine of the district's eleven counties. Conklin won Centre (58%) and Clearfield (55%). To date, it is the last time that a Democrat has come close to winning what has long been one of the most Republican districts in Pennsylvania.


=== Bush Era elections (2002, 2004, and 2006) ===

In the redistricting after the 2000 Census, Centre County was taken out of the district while portions of Somerset, Cambria, Indiana, Fayette, and Cumberland Counties were added to the district. In November 2002, the district reverted to form, and Shuster won his first full term, defeating John R. Henry 71%–29%.Unlike 2002, Shuster was challenged in the 2004 Republican primary. He defeated businessman Michael DelGrosso 51%–49%. In November, he won re-election to his second full term, defeating Democrat Paul Politis 70%–30%, winning every county in the district.Shuster won re-election to his third full term in 2006, defeating Democrat Tony Barr 60%–40%. He lost only three counties: Clearfield, Cambria, and Fayette.


=== Obama Era elections (2008, 2010, 2012, and 2014) ===

Shuster won re-election to his fourth full term in 2008, defeating Democrat Tony Barr again, 64%–36%. This time he won all fourteen counties.In 2010, Shuster won re-election to his fifth full term, defeating Democrat Tom Conners 73%–27%, winning all fourteen counties.After redistricting following the 2010 Census, the 9th moved even further to the west, gaining portions of Westmoreland, Greene, and Washington Counties. Shuster won re-election to his sixth full term, defeating Democrat Karen Ramsburg 62%–38%. With the 113th Congress, elected in 2012, Bill Shuster became Chairman of the House Transportation Committee, a position he would hold for the following 2 Congresses.
In 2014, Shuster was in a primary with Bedford County businessman Art Halvorson and Franklin County project manager Travis Schooley. The primary was held on May 20, 2014. Congressman Shuster won with 53% of the vote. Art Halvorson received 34% and Travis Schooley received 13%.


=== Trump Era election (2016) ===

In 2016, Shuster won reelection in what would later turn out to be his eighth and final full term. He was challenged by Arthur Halvorson in the Republican primary, with Shuster only barely winning a majority, at 50.6%, in the two-way race. In a set of events that even Arthur Halvorson described as unprecedented, Halvorson received enough write-ins in the Democratic primary to become the Democratic Party's candidate in the 9th District. Halvorson, who is considered to be further to the right than Shuster, accepted the Democratic nomination, but vowed to causus as a conservative Republican if elected to Congress. In the general election, Shuster beat Halvorson again, this time with 63.3% of the vote.
Shuster announced in January 2018 that he wouldn't be seeking reelection later that year, and that he thus would be retiring with the end of the 115th Congress in January 2019. The Congressman, who has been Chairman of the House Transportation Committee since 2013, said he would be spending his final year in the House working with President Trump on what he describes as a "massive infrastructure bill". Shuster cited his desire to pass such a bill, and the fact that worrying about getting reelected would distract from the bill, as reasons for his retirement.

In a set of events that even Arthur Halvorson described as unprecedented, Halvorson received enough write-ins in the Democratic primary to become the Democratic Party's candidate in the 9th District. Halvorson, who is considered to be further to the right than Shuster, accepted the Democratic nomination, but vowed to causus as a conservative Republican if elected to Congress. In the general election, Shuster beat Halvorson again, this time with 63.3% of the vote.
