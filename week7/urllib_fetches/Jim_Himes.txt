== Issues ==


=== Abortion ===
Planned Parenthood gives Himes a 100% pro-choice rating. He voted against the Stupak-Pitts Amendment in the Affordable Health Care for America Act that was intended to prevent any federal funds from paying for any health care plan with abortion coverage.


=== Defense ===
Himes states that "we should reduce our presence in Afghanistan as rapidly as possible and reshape our mission to focus exclusively on counterterrorism", yet requiring "presence in the region, but one considerably smaller than that required by our present strategy of nation-building." He believes in a world free of nuclear weapons, and readily supports sanctions against Iran. He voted for the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010. He supports a two-state solution between Israel and Palestine.


=== Education ===
Himes believes that early childhood education is "the most intelligent investment a nation can make in its future," and voted to double funding for Early Head Start Program. He stated in 2008 that No Child Left Behind "is well-intentioned because it focuses on education, but it must be reformed." Himes also co-authored an amendment to the Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act that promoted the financial literacy of students.


=== Environment ===
Environment America has given Himes a 100% rating. He believes that "By creating the right set of financial incentives and supporting a broad range of research and development, we can deliver the energy our economy requires to thrive while protecting our planet." He also voted for the American Clean Energy and Security Act.


=== Financial services ===
Himes is the chair of the New Democrat Coalition ("New Dems"), a group of business-centric Democrats. The New Dem PAC, which has worked to recruit more moderate Democrats as candidates for Congress this year, receives significant funding from the banking industry. (https://newdemocratcoalition-himes.house.gov/about-us/our-agenda).   
In May 2018, Himes (a former Goldman Sachs employee and member of the Financial Services Committee) voted with house republicans to fulfill Trump's campaign promise to roll back Obama era protections put in place to prevent another financial meltdown. Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act, known as the Crapo bill for its primary sponsor, Mike Crapo, a Republican senator from Idaho freed thousands of banks with less than $250 billion in assets from stricter federal oversight. (https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/2155). 
Critics of Himes, who's biggest campaign contributors come from the Securities & Investment and Insurance industries (https://www.opensecrets.org/members-of-congress/summary?cid=N00029070), say his vote guts consumer protections and increases the risk of another financial crisis.  Foreign banks that pose major risks, such as the Trump-friendly Deutsche Bank, will see their United States subsidiaries deregulated.  Himes' district include Greenwich, CT, home to many large Hedge Funds and financial services employees. 
Of the 33 House Democrats voting in support of the repeal bill, 27 are members of the New Dems. 
However, most democrats and progressives opposed the bill.  Nancy Pelosi said “the bill would take us back to the days when unchecked recklessness on Wall Street ignited an historic financial meltdown.”  
Despite his vote to roll back provisions of Dodd-Frank, Himes touts his accomplishment in helping draft, pass, and defend Dodd-Frank.  His website states: 
"When I first took office in 2009, I immediately began working with my colleagues on the House Financial Services Committee to write the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, also known as Dodd-Frank. This landmark legislation was crafted amidst the wreckage of a disaster that threw more than eight million people out of work and obliterated nearly $16 trillion in American wealth. This was the most significant overhaul of our nation’s financial regulations in decades. This landmark law put in place tough new rules to protect consumers and monitor irresponsible behavior.
Unfortunately, we are now forced to defend against multiple efforts undo all of the protections we have instituted. Legislation has passed the House of Representatives to strip power away from the SEC and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau; make it easier for banks to gamble with taxpayer money by repealing the Volcker Rule; and opens the door for more bailouts. I will continue to fight against these attacks on behalf of American consumers and taxpayers."(https://himes.house.gov/financial-services-depth)
At the bill-signing ceremony, Trump praised democrats' support stating, “Dodd-Frank was something they said could not be touched and, honestly, a lot of great Democrats knew that it had to be done,” he said.

On March 6, 2013, Himes co-sponsored H.R. 992  which rolls back provisions in section 716 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Citigroup's recommendations were reflected in more than 70 lines of the House Financial Services committee's 85-line bill. Two crucial paragraphs, prepared by Citigroup in conjunction with other Wall Street banks, were copied nearly word for word.  According to the Congressional Budget Office "H.R. 992 would allow certain financial firms to retain financial portfolios containing swaps while remaining eligible for assistance from the Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)."
Himes vorted for H.R. 922., the Swaps Regulatory Improvement Act. He also voted for H.R. 2374, the Retail Investor Protection Act.


=== Gun issues ===
Himes voted against H.R. 627 which allowed loaded guns into national parks. The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence gives him a 100% lifetime score for his support of more gun regulations.


=== Health care ===
Himes supports the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. He believes in preserving Medicare and Medicaid and says we must be "prepared to equitably reform these programs to address the challenging problem of rising health care costs and ensure that these important safety net programs are here to help this generation and the next."


=== The Fourth Amendment ===
Himes voted against H.R. 2397 which was to defund the NSA domestic phone metadata spying program. As one who is against the NSA's metadata spying program, Himes states that he voted against H.R. 2397 not because he objects to the principle of limiting the NSA's power, but because the bill was created in a reactionary manner and stripped the NSA of too much power.


=== Transportation ===
Himes co-sponsored H.R. 402, The National Infrastructure Development Bank Act of 2011, which would objectively fund national infrastructure projects. According to Himes, it would also "attract private investment and facilitate private sector partnering with regions, states and localities to borrow from the Bank while adding its own private equity to projects." He has helped bring money to the 4th district, such as "over $70 million for safety improvements, resurfacing, enhancements, and bridge improvements to the Merritt Parkway; over $11 million for infrastructure improvements at the Steel Point project in Bridgeport that will generate thousands of new jobs; and $30 million for upgrades to Metro North’s Danbury Branch line."


=== Animal rights and wildlife issues ===
In 2009-2010, the Society for Animal Protective legislation gave Himes a rating of 100% for his support of animal protection. In 2009, Himes was given a rating of 100% by the Defenders of Wildlife Action Fund for his position on wildlife action.

=== Immigration ===

=== Electoral College and presidential selection ===
Himes lobbied the Electoral College to refuse to vote for Donald Trump and to instead elect Hillary Clinton. On December 12, 2016, in an interview on CNN's New Day, he said that he was troubled by several actions by the president-elect. The issue that "pushed me over the edge" was Trump's criticism of the CIA and the intelligence community. The Congressman did admit that Trump won "fair and square," but he said that Trump proved himself unfit for public office. He cited the intentions behind the creation of the electoral college and he argued that it was created for an instance such as the election of Trump.

== Issues ==


=== Abortion ===
Planned Parenthood gives Himes a 100% pro-choice rating. He voted against the Stupak-Pitts Amendment in the Affordable Health Care for America Act that was intended to prevent any federal funds from paying for any health care plan with abortion coverage.


=== Defense ===
Himes states that "we should reduce our presence in Afghanistan as rapidly as possible and reshape our mission to focus exclusively on counterterrorism", yet requiring "presence in the region, but one considerably smaller than that required by our present strategy of nation-building." He believes in a world free of nuclear weapons, and readily supports sanctions against Iran. He voted for the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010. He supports a two-state solution between Israel and Palestine.


=== Education ===
Himes believes that early childhood education is "the most intelligent investment a nation can make in its future," and voted to double funding for Early Head Start Program. He stated in 2008 that No Child Left Behind "is well-intentioned because it focuses on education, but it must be reformed." Himes also co-authored an amendment to the Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act that promoted the financial literacy of students.


=== Environment ===
Environment America has given Himes a 100% rating. He believes that "By creating the right set of financial incentives and supporting a broad range of research and development, we can deliver the energy our economy requires to thrive while protecting our planet." He also voted for the American Clean Energy and Security Act.


=== Financial services ===
Himes is the chair of the New Democrat Coalition ("New Dems"), a group of business-centric Democrats. The New Dem PAC, which has worked to recruit more moderate Democrats as candidates for Congress this year, receives significant funding from the banking industry. (https://newdemocratcoalition-himes.house.gov/about-us/our-agenda).   
In May 2018, Himes (a former Goldman Sachs employee and member of the Financial Services Committee) voted with house republicans to fulfill Trump's campaign promise to roll back Obama era protections put in place to prevent another financial meltdown. Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act, known as the Crapo bill for its primary sponsor, Mike Crapo, a Republican senator from Idaho freed thousands of banks with less than $250 billion in assets from stricter federal oversight. (https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/2155). 
Critics of Himes, who's biggest campaign contributors come from the Securities & Investment and Insurance industries (https://www.opensecrets.org/members-of-congress/summary?cid=N00029070), say his vote guts consumer protections and increases the risk of another financial crisis.  Foreign banks that pose major risks, such as the Trump-friendly Deutsche Bank, will see their United States subsidiaries deregulated.  Himes' district include Greenwich, CT, home to many large Hedge Funds and financial services employees. 
Of the 33 House Democrats voting in support of the repeal bill, 27 are members of the New Dems. 
However, most democrats and progressives opposed the bill.  Nancy Pelosi said “the bill would take us back to the days when unchecked recklessness on Wall Street ignited an historic financial meltdown.”  
Despite his vote to roll back provisions of Dodd-Frank, Himes touts his accomplishment in helping draft, pass, and defend Dodd-Frank.  His website states: 
"When I first took office in 2009, I immediately began working with my colleagues on the House Financial Services Committee to write the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, also known as Dodd-Frank. This landmark legislation was crafted amidst the wreckage of a disaster that threw more than eight million people out of work and obliterated nearly $16 trillion in American wealth. This was the most significant overhaul of our nation’s financial regulations in decades. This landmark law put in place tough new rules to protect consumers and monitor irresponsible behavior.
Unfortunately, we are now forced to defend against multiple efforts undo all of the protections we have instituted. Legislation has passed the House of Representatives to strip power away from the SEC and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau; make it easier for banks to gamble with taxpayer money by repealing the Volcker Rule; and opens the door for more bailouts. I will continue to fight against these attacks on behalf of American consumers and taxpayers."(https://himes.house.gov/financial-services-depth)
At the bill-signing ceremony, Trump praised democrats' support stating, “Dodd-Frank was something they said could not be touched and, honestly, a lot of great Democrats knew that it had to be done,” he said.

On March 6, 2013, Himes co-sponsored H.R. 992  which rolls back provisions in section 716 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Citigroup's recommendations were reflected in more than 70 lines of the House Financial Services committee's 85-line bill. Two crucial paragraphs, prepared by Citigroup in conjunction with other Wall Street banks, were copied nearly word for word.  According to the Congressional Budget Office "H.R. 992 would allow certain financial firms to retain financial portfolios containing swaps while remaining eligible for assistance from the Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)."
Himes vorted for H.R. 922., the Swaps Regulatory Improvement Act. He also voted for H.R. 2374, the Retail Investor Protection Act.


=== Gun issues ===
Himes voted against H.R. 627 which allowed loaded guns into national parks. The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence gives him a 100% lifetime score for his support of more gun regulations.


=== Health care ===
Himes supports the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. He believes in preserving Medicare and Medicaid and says we must be "prepared to equitably reform these programs to address the challenging problem of rising health care costs and ensure that these important safety net programs are here to help this generation and the next."


=== The Fourth Amendment ===
Himes voted against H.R. 2397 which was to defund the NSA domestic phone metadata spying program. As one who is against the NSA's metadata spying program, Himes states that he voted against H.R. 2397 not because he objects to the principle of limiting the NSA's power, but because the bill was created in a reactionary manner and stripped the NSA of too much power.


=== Transportation ===
Himes co-sponsored H.R. 402, The National Infrastructure Development Bank Act of 2011, which would objectively fund national infrastructure projects. According to Himes, it would also "attract private investment and facilitate private sector partnering with regions, states and localities to borrow from the Bank while adding its own private equity to projects." He has helped bring money to the 4th district, such as "over $70 million for safety improvements, resurfacing, enhancements, and bridge improvements to the Merritt Parkway; over $11 million for infrastructure improvements at the Steel Point project in Bridgeport that will generate thousands of new jobs; and $30 million for upgrades to Metro North’s Danbury Branch line."


=== Animal rights and wildlife issues ===
In 2009-2010, the Society for Animal Protective legislation gave Himes a rating of 100% for his support of animal protection. In 2009, Himes was given a rating of 100% by the Defenders of Wildlife Action Fund for his position on wildlife action.


=== LGBT rights ===
In 2009-2010, the Human Rights Campaign gave Himes a rating of 100%.


=== Immigration ===
In 2009-2010, the American Immigration Lawyers Association gave Himes a rating of 100% for his stance on the defense of illegal immigrants in the U.S.


=== Electoral College and presidential selection ===
Himes lobbied the Electoral College to refuse to vote for Donald Trump and to instead elect Hillary Clinton. On December 12, 2016, in an interview on CNN's New Day, he said that he was troubled by several actions by the president-elect. The issue that "pushed me over the edge" was Trump's criticism of the CIA and the intelligence community. The Congressman did admit that Trump won "fair and square," but he said that Trump proved himself unfit for public office. He cited the intentions behind the creation of the electoral college and he argued that it was created for an instance such as the election of Trump.


== Political campaigns ==


=== 2008 ===

Himes faced the ten-term Republican incumbent Chris Shays in the 2008 congressional election, along with Libertarian nominee M.A. Carrano, a professional philosophy writer and systems consultant, and Green Party nominee Richard Duffee. Winning by a margin of 51 percent to 47 percent, While Shays won 14 of the district's 17 towns, Himes won all three of the district's large cities—Bridgeport, Norwalk and Stamford.  Ultimately, he owed his victory to swamping Shays in Bridgeport, winning a staggering 80 percent of the vote there. He was also helped by Barack Obama's massive win in that district; Obama carried the 4th with 60 percent of the vote, one of the largest margins Obama recorded in a Republican-held district.
Himes took office in the 111th United States Congress on January 6, 2009. He is the first Democrat to represent the district since Donald J. Irwin left office in 1969, and only the second since 1943. Shays was the sole Republican congressman from New England, and Himes's win made New England's House delegation entirely Democratic for the first time in history.


=== 2010 ===

Along with the three towns that he won in 2008, Himes also won Redding, Weston, and Westport, and won Fairfield by nine votes.The campaign raised $3,660,497.57, $3,603,727 of which was spent.

Himes did not self-finance at all. The majority of his money, 74%, came from in-state. Only 26% came from out of state. Rep. Himes disclosed 97.9% of his donations.

== Issues ==


=== Abortion ===
Planned Parenthood gives Himes a 100% pro-choice rating. He voted against the Stupak-Pitts Amendment in the Affordable Health Care for America Act that was intended to prevent any federal funds from paying for any health care plan with abortion coverage.


=== Defense ===
Himes states that "we should reduce our presence in Afghanistan as rapidly as possible and reshape our mission to focus exclusively on counterterrorism", yet requiring "presence in the region, but one considerably smaller than that required by our present strategy of nation-building." He believes in a world free of nuclear weapons, and readily supports sanctions against Iran. He voted for the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010. He supports a two-state solution between Israel and Palestine.


=== Education ===
Himes believes that early childhood education is "the most intelligent investment a nation can make in its future," and voted to double funding for Early Head Start Program. He stated in 2008 that No Child Left Behind "is well-intentioned because it focuses on education, but it must be reformed." Himes also co-authored an amendment to the Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act that promoted the financial literacy of students.


=== Environment ===
Environment America has given Himes a 100% rating. He believes that "By creating the right set of financial incentives and supporting a broad range of research and development, we can deliver the energy our economy requires to thrive while protecting our planet." He also voted for the American Clean Energy and Security Act.


=== Financial services ===
Himes is the chair of the New Democrat Coalition ("New Dems"), a group of business-centric Democrats. The New Dem PAC, which has worked to recruit more moderate Democrats as candidates for Congress this year, receives significant funding from the banking industry. (https://newdemocratcoalition-himes.house.gov/about-us/our-agenda).   
In May 2018, Himes (a former Goldman Sachs employee and member of the Financial Services Committee) voted with house republicans to fulfill Trump's campaign promise to roll back Obama era protections put in place to prevent another financial meltdown. Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act, known as the Crapo bill for its primary sponsor, Mike Crapo, a Republican senator from Idaho freed thousands of banks with less than $250 billion in assets from stricter federal oversight. (https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/2155). 
Critics of Himes, who's biggest campaign contributors come from the Securities & Investment and Insurance industries (https://www.opensecrets.org/members-of-congress/summary?cid=N00029070), say his vote guts consumer protections and increases the risk of another financial crisis.  Foreign banks that pose major risks, such as the Trump-friendly Deutsche Bank, will see their United States subsidiaries deregulated.  Himes' district include Greenwich, CT, home to many large Hedge Funds and financial services employees. 
Of the 33 House Democrats voting in support of the repeal bill, 27 are members of the New Dems. 
However, most democrats and progressives opposed the bill.  Nancy Pelosi said “the bill would take us back to the days when unchecked recklessness on Wall Street ignited an historic financial meltdown.”  
Despite his vote to roll back provisions of Dodd-Frank, Himes touts his accomplishment in helping draft, pass, and defend Dodd-Frank.  His website states: 
"When I first took office in 2009, I immediately began working with my colleagues on the House Financial Services Committee to write the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, also known as Dodd-Frank. This landmark legislation was crafted amidst the wreckage of a disaster that threw more than eight million people out of work and obliterated nearly $16 trillion in American wealth. This was the most significant overhaul of our nation’s financial regulations in decades. This landmark law put in place tough new rules to protect consumers and monitor irresponsible behavior.
Unfortunately, we are now forced to defend against multiple efforts undo all of the protections we have instituted. Legislation has passed the House of Representatives to strip power away from the SEC and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau; make it easier for banks to gamble with taxpayer money by repealing the Volcker Rule; and opens the door for more bailouts. I will continue to fight against these attacks on behalf of American consumers and taxpayers."(https://himes.house.gov/financial-services-depth)
At the bill-signing ceremony, Trump praised democrats' support stating, “Dodd-Frank was something they said could not be touched and, honestly, a lot of great Democrats knew that it had to be done,” he said.

On March 6, 2013, Himes co-sponsored H.R. 992  which rolls back provisions in section 716 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Citigroup's recommendations were reflected in more than 70 lines of the House Financial Services committee's 85-line bill. Two crucial paragraphs, prepared by Citigroup in conjunction with other Wall Street banks, were copied nearly word for word.  According to the Congressional Budget Office "H.R. 992 would allow certain financial firms to retain financial portfolios containing swaps while remaining eligible for assistance from the Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)."
Himes vorted for H.R. 922., the Swaps Regulatory Improvement Act. He also voted for H.R. 2374, the Retail Investor Protection Act.


=== Gun issues ===
Himes voted against H.R. 627 which allowed loaded guns into national parks. The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence gives him a 100% lifetime score for his support of more gun regulations.


=== Health care ===
Himes supports the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. He believes in preserving Medicare and Medicaid and says we must be "prepared to equitably reform these programs to address the challenging problem of rising health care costs and ensure that these important safety net programs are here to help this generation and the next."


=== The Fourth Amendment ===
Himes voted against H.R. 2397 which was to defund the NSA domestic phone metadata spying program. As one who is against the NSA's metadata spying program, Himes states that he voted against H.R. 2397 not because he objects to the principle of limiting the NSA's power, but because the bill was created in a reactionary manner and stripped the NSA of too much power.


=== Transportation ===
Himes co-sponsored H.R. 402, The National Infrastructure Development Bank Act of 2011, which would objectively fund national infrastructure projects. According to Himes, it would also "attract private investment and facilitate private sector partnering with regions, states and localities to borrow from the Bank while adding its own private equity to projects." He has helped bring money to the 4th district, such as "over $70 million for safety improvements, resurfacing, enhancements, and bridge improvements to the Merritt Parkway; over $11 million for infrastructure improvements at the Steel Point project in Bridgeport that will generate thousands of new jobs; and $30 million for upgrades to Metro North’s Danbury Branch line."


=== Animal rights and wildlife issues ===
In 2009-2010, the Society for Animal Protective legislation gave Himes a rating of 100% for his support of animal protection. In 2009, Himes was given a rating of 100% by the Defenders of Wildlife Action Fund for his position on wildlife action.


=== LGBT rights ===

=== Immigration ===
In 2009-2010, the American Immigration Lawyers Association gave Himes a rating of 100% for his stance on the defense of illegal immigrants in the U.S.


=== Electoral College and presidential selection ===
Himes lobbied the Electoral College to refuse to vote for Donald Trump and to instead elect Hillary Clinton. On December 12, 2016, in an interview on CNN's New Day, he said that he was troubled by several actions by the president-elect. The issue that "pushed me over the edge" was Trump's criticism of the CIA and the intelligence community. The Congressman did admit that Trump won "fair and square," but he said that Trump proved himself unfit for public office. He cited the intentions behind the creation of the electoral college and he argued that it was created for an instance such as the election of Trump.
