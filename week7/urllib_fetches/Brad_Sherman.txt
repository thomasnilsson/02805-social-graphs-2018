Dababneh was elected to the California State Assembly in 2013, and resigning from that body after allegations of sexual assault and other misconduct were made against him.

In December 2017, eight former aides to Sherman said that his offices in Washington, D.C. and California had a toxic environment characterized by frequent "verbal abuse from the congressman and senior staff that made them feel bullied and demoralized." A focus of the criticism was Matt Dababneh, Sherman's district director and a close advisor, who began working for Sherman in 2005, and became district director to Sherman in 2009. Dababneh was elected to the California State Assembly in 2013, and resigning from that body after allegations of sexual assault and other misconduct were made against him. Former employees in Sherman's office told the Los Angeles Times that Dababneh frequently made inappropriate sexual remarks, including degrading and sexist comments, and bragged about his sexual exploits.

And I talk to each staff member several times a year about the office policy."
