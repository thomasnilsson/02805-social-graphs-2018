== Early life and education ==
Love was born Ludmya Bourdeau on December 6, 1975, in the New York City borough of Brooklyn, the daughter of Mary and Jean Maxine Bourdeau. At a time of political repression, her parents emigrated together from Haiti in 1973, leaving their two older children behind with family. Her father had been threatened by the Tonton Macoute, the secret police in Haiti, and her parents traveled to the United States on a tourist visa. They spoke only French when they arrived. Her father became a paint-company manager and her mother worked as a nurse.Love's birth enabled her parents to gain a U.S. residency permit (green card) under an immigration law that favored immigrants from the Western Hemisphere who had a child born in the United States; it expired in early 1976.  They later became naturalized citizens.When Love was five, her family moved from Brooklyn to Norwalk, Connecticut. Love attended Norwalk High School. She was raised as a Roman Catholic in the faith of her parents. After the family settled in Norwalk, her parents brought her older siblings from Haiti to reunite the family.Love attended the University of Hartford Hartt School with a half-tuition scholarship. She graduated with a degree in musical theatre.After college, she worked at Sento Corporation and the Echopass Corporation. She was also a flight attendant with Continental Airlines. She moved to Utah in 1998 after converting to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and while working for Continental. There she married Jason Love.


== Early political career ==
Love began to be active in civic affairs when she served as the community spokesperson in Saratoga Springs, Utah in an effort to persuade the developer of her neighborhood to spray against flies. The city of 18,000 near Salt Lake City was established in 1997 and has had rapid growth.
In 2003 Love won a seat on the Saratoga Springs City Council. She was the first female Haitian-American elected official in Utah County; she took office in January 2004. During an economic downturn, as part of the city council Love approved a transition from the agriculture tax to municipal tax. She worked with other city council members to cut expenses, reducing the city's shortfall during the economic downturn from $3.5 million to $779,000. Saratoga Springs now has the highest possible bond rating for a city of its size.After six years on the Council, Love was elected mayor, winning with 861 votes to 594 for her opponent Jeff Francom. She served from January 2010 to January 2014. During her term, Love led the city in dealing with natural disasters, including a wildfire, followed shortly afterward by a severe mudslide.


== Elections ==


=== 2012 ===

Love ran in Utah's 4th congressional district, which was created after the 2010 Census. She competed for the Republican nomination against attorney Jay Cobb and State Reps. Stephen Sandstrom of Orem and Carl Wimmer of Herriman; she won the nomination on April 21, 2012, at the 2012 Utah Republican Party Convention with over 70 percent of the vote. She faced six-term Democratic incumbent Jim Matheson in the general election, who while living in the 2nd congressional district ran in the new 4th district, losing some of his reliably Democratic constituents.
Nationally, Love received campaign support from 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and his wife Ann Romney, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, House Budget Committee Chairman and 2012 Republican vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan, and Speaker of the House John Boehner.In 2012, National Journal named Love one of ten Republicans to follow on Twitter. When speaking to the 2012 Republican National Convention on August 28, 2012, she discussed lessons learned from her parents, immigrants from Haiti who fled political repression. She said, "Mr. President, I am here to tell you we are not buying what you are selling in 2012."In September 2012, questions arose about her parents' immigrant status. Forbes investigated a claim in an article that month in Mother Jones that no law existed in 1976 that would have allowed Love's parents to become citizens of the United States after her birth. Forbes found that immigrants who had been residents of the Western Hemisphere could get long-term residency permits (green cards) if they had a child born in the United States. Mother Jones issued a correction. In an October 2012 interview, her father said that Mia's birth as a U.S. citizen was key to him and his wife gaining permanent legal status and ultimately citizenship.Love lost the election to Jim Matheson by 768 votes out of 245,277 votes cast, a difference of 0.31%. She was regarded to have run a weak campaign, switching campaign managers three times, trying to "nationalize" the race rather than focus on local issues, and missing interviews and appointments because of rifts in her campaign staff.


=== 2014 ===

In March 2013, Love said she was seriously considering another run against Matheson. In May 2013 she announced she would run in 2014. As of  July 2013, Love had raised over $475,000 for her campaign. Love was an opening speaker at the 2013 Western Conservative Summit. She spoke of the need for increased grassroots organization in the GOP, and the need to be independent from the government.In August 2013, Love was chosen by Newsmax as an "Up and Comer" in their list of top "25 Influential Women of the GOP," given her visible position as a young black female Republican. In November 2013, Love acknowledged the growing consensus that the Tea Party needed to shift away from being the "party of no," disagreeing with its part in forcing a federal government shutdown over the budget. She later reiterated her support for the philosophy of the Tea Party and many of its leaders, including Utah Sen. Mike Lee.On December 17, 2013, Matheson announced that he would not run for re-election. Love was ranked as the favored candidate due to her name recognition and characteristics of the district. In early October 2014, the National Journal listed Utah's 4th district as the number one most likely district to change hands in November.In early 2014 Love was made a member of the Republican National Committee's National Advisory Council on African-American outreach. On April 26, 2014 Love won the Republican nomination for the 4th congressional district at the Utah Republican Convention, with 78% of the vote at the convention.On election night, Democratic Party nominee Doug Owens led Love until late in the evening, when she pulled ahead and ultimately won by more than 7,000 votes. Reacting to her victory, Love took a shot at the media's perceived obsession with identity politics, joking to her supporters: "Many of the naysayers out there said that Utah would never elect a black, Republican, LDS woman to Congress. Not only did we do it, we were the first to do it."


=== 2016 ===

Love ran for re-election in 2016. She defeated Democrat Doug Owens in the general election with 54% of the vote, over 12 points ahead of her nearest challenger. David Scott, a Democratic Representative from Georgia, gave $1,000 to Love's campaign.


=== 2018 ===

Love is currently defending her seat against Democrat Ben McAdams. In June 2018, CNN stated that the race was considered "consequential to both parties" because Love has "stood up to [President Donald Trump] on immigration" and "because national Democrats see McAdams as one of their best chances to gain a foothold on red turf."According to political polling and reporting website FiveThirtyEight, Love's votes have aligned with Trump's positions 96% of the time, as of August 2018.As of  August 2018, RealClearPolitics ranks the race as a "toss up". A poll performed in June 2018 shows McAdams within 6 percentage points of Love, within the poll's margin of error. As of July 2017, Love's and McAdams' campaigns have approximately equal levels of cash on hand.


== U.S. House of Representatives ==

With the start of the new Congress, Love was appointed to the House Financial Services Committee.
Love joined the Congressional Black Caucus in January 2015 after taking her seat. While campaigning in 2012, Love had said that if elected, she would "join the Congressional Black Caucus and try to take that thing apart from the inside out." She described the mainly Democratic Caucus as characterized by "demagoguery. They sit there and ignite emotions and ignite racism when there isn't. They use their positions to instill fear. Hope and change is turned into fear and blame. Fear that everybody is going to lose everything and blaming Congress for everything instead of taking responsibility." She later acknowledged the bonds created with fellow caucus members. "As the only female Republican member of the Congressional Black Caucus, I have the opportunity every day to work across the aisle on issues that are divisive but important," she said. "My faith and my belief in the humanity of every one of God's children helps me to work with my Congressional Black Caucus colleagues on important issues like criminal justice reform."In May 2015, she was a lead sponsor along with Duncan D. Hunter of HR 2518 the Student Right to Know Before You Go Act, designed to increase the amount of information universities and colleges are required to provide prospective students.In October 2015, Love was named to serve on the Select Investigative Panel on Planned Parenthood.In April 2016, Love got her first bill through the U.S. House. HR3791, which was approved in a 247–171 vote, raises limits on how large community banks can grow, which Love says will make more credit available.In December 2017, Love introduced the Stop Taxpayers Obligations to Perpetrators of Sexual Harassment Act. Passed by the U.S. House in February 2018, the bill would prevent members of Congress from settling sexual harassment claims with taxpayer money.In March 2018, Love became a supporter of creating federal laws against pyramid schemes. She also supported adding multi-vitamins to the list of items that could be purchased with food stamps.Love has been among those who have called on the Department of Education to not block state regulation of student loan providers.In May 2018 a defense bill included language that was co-authored by Love along with two other congresswomen that required the military to begin an investigation into the effects of military policies of doing in-depth investigations against service members who bring charges of sexual assault.Also in the spring of 2018 Love signed a discharge petition seeking to force a floor vote in the US House on a bills to change immigration legislation to do such things as grant regular status to people who came to the US without authorization when they were minors. This time period actually saw Love advocating on several fronts in relation to immigration. She also was the co-leader with Pramila Jayapal of an effort to keep in place rules that allowed accompanying spouses of H-4 Visa holders to have work authorization while in the United States.In May 2018 The Small Bank Holding Company Relief Act that Love had authored was passed into law.Love is a member of the Congressional Western Caucus and the Climate Solutions Caucus.

Love supports Utah's effort to reclaim public land from federal agency controls.Love's entrée into politics occurred after she and her husband bought a house on a lake in Utah that had a growing midge population. Love says that at the urging of her neighbors, she complained to the developer of the land and prompted a regular pesticide treatment. Stephanie Mencimer of Mother Jones wrote that "rather than focus her political activism on cleaning up the lake, or the environment more generally, she just wanted to kill the bugs and move on.


=== Economic and budget issues ===
In her 2012 campaign, Love proposed dramatically reducing food entitlement spending like free school lunches and food assistance to pregnant mothers and the poor. She defended these proposed cuts by saying people who are poor will become dependent if they don't work for their food.Love proposed a blueprint that would cut federal spending by $750 billion, with a focus on cutting entitlements like free school lunch, special education funding, subsidized school loans, funds aimed at preventing homelessness, healthcare subsidies, Medicaid spending, and food assistance. She has said her proposed cuts are a "nasty-tasting medicine" needed for the country to run properly.Love believes that the federal government should have less power.  Love was described as a Tea Party conservative in 2012. In a 2015 article titled "How 'tea party' is Mia Love?", the Washington Post wrote that "Love's rhetoric from 2012 to 2014 changed a bit, even as her policy positions remained fairly constant" and noted that Love had "angered some conservatives when she questioned the tea party driven government shutdown in 2013 over Obamacare."

Mia Love Haitian Embassy, Pearls of Excellence ExhibitLudmya "Mia" Love (née Bourdeau; December 6, 1975) is an American politician serving as the U.S. Representative for Utah's 4th congressional district since 2015. A Haitian American, Love is the first black female Republican elected to Congress and the first Haitian American elected to Congress from the state of Utah.Born to Haitian parents in the New York City borough of Brooklyn, Love was elected mayor of Saratoga Springs, Utah in 2010. She was previously on its city council. In 2012, Love ran for Utah's 4th congressional district, losing narrowly to incumbent Democratic Party U.S. Representative Jim Matheson. She was a speaker at the 2012 Republican National Convention. She was elected as a Republican to the House of Representatives on November 4, 2014, defeating Democratic opponent Doug Owens; she also defeated him again in a 2016 rematch to win her second term. She is currently defending her seat against Salt Lake County Mayor Ben McAdams in the 2018 midterm elections, in a race rated by RealClearPolitics as a toss-up as of September 2018.


== Early life and education ==
Love was born Ludmya Bourdeau on December 6, 1975, in the New York City borough of Brooklyn, the daughter of Mary and Jean Maxine Bourdeau. At a time of political repression, her parents emigrated together from Haiti in 1973, leaving their two older children behind with family. Her father had been threatened by the Tonton Macoute, the secret police in Haiti, and her parents traveled to the United States on a tourist visa. They spoke only French when they arrived. Her father became a paint-company manager and her mother worked as a nurse.Love's birth enabled her parents to gain a U.S. residency permit (green card) under an immigration law that favored immigrants from the Western Hemisphere who had a child born in the United States; it expired in early 1976.  They later became naturalized citizens.When Love was five, her family moved from Brooklyn to Norwalk, Connecticut. Love attended Norwalk High School. She was raised as a Roman Catholic in the faith of her parents. After the family settled in Norwalk, her parents brought her older siblings from Haiti to reunite the family.Love attended the University of Hartford Hartt School with a half-tuition scholarship. She graduated with a degree in musical theatre.After college, she worked at Sento Corporation and the Echopass Corporation. She was also a flight attendant with Continental Airlines. She moved to Utah in 1998 after converting to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and while working for Continental. There she married Jason Love.


== Early political career ==
Love began to be active in civic affairs when she served as the community spokesperson in Saratoga Springs, Utah in an effort to persuade the developer of her neighborhood to spray against flies. The city of 18,000 near Salt Lake City was established in 1997 and has had rapid growth.
In 2003 Love won a seat on the Saratoga Springs City Council. She was the first female Haitian-American elected official in Utah County; she took office in January 2004. During an economic downturn, as part of the city council Love approved a transition from the agriculture tax to municipal tax. She worked with other city council members to cut expenses, reducing the city's shortfall during the economic downturn from $3.5 million to $779,000. Saratoga Springs now has the highest possible bond rating for a city of its size.After six years on the Council, Love was elected mayor, winning with 861 votes to 594 for her opponent Jeff Francom. She served from January 2010 to January 2014. During her term, Love led the city in dealing with natural disasters, including a wildfire, followed shortly afterward by a severe mudslide.


== Elections ==


=== 2012 ===

Love ran in Utah's 4th congressional district, which was created after the 2010 Census. She competed for the Republican nomination against attorney Jay Cobb and State Reps. Stephen Sandstrom of Orem and Carl Wimmer of Herriman; she won the nomination on April 21, 2012, at the 2012 Utah Republican Party Convention with over 70 percent of the vote. She faced six-term Democratic incumbent Jim Matheson in the general election, who while living in the 2nd congressional district ran in the new 4th district, losing some of his reliably Democratic constituents.
Nationally, Love received campaign support from 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and his wife Ann Romney, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, House Budget Committee Chairman and 2012 Republican vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan, and Speaker of the House John Boehner.In 2012, National Journal named Love one of ten Republicans to follow on Twitter. When speaking to the 2012 Republican National Convention on August 28, 2012, she discussed lessons learned from her parents, immigrants from Haiti who fled political repression. She said, "Mr. President, I am here to tell you we are not buying what you are selling in 2012."In September 2012, questions arose about her parents' immigrant status. Forbes investigated a claim in an article that month in Mother Jones that no law existed in 1976 that would have allowed Love's parents to become citizens of the United States after her birth. Forbes found that immigrants who had been residents of the Western Hemisphere could get long-term residency permits (green cards) if they had a child born in the United States. Mother Jones issued a correction. In an October 2012 interview, her father said that Mia's birth as a U.S. citizen was key to him and his wife gaining permanent legal status and ultimately citizenship.Love lost the election to Jim Matheson by 768 votes out of 245,277 votes cast, a difference of 0.31%. She was regarded to have run a weak campaign, switching campaign managers three times, trying to "nationalize" the race rather than focus on local issues, and missing interviews and appointments because of rifts in her campaign staff.


=== 2014 ===

In March 2013, Love said she was seriously considering another run against Matheson. In May 2013 she announced she would run in 2014. As of  July 2013, Love had raised over $475,000 for her campaign. Love was an opening speaker at the 2013 Western Conservative Summit. She spoke of the need for increased grassroots organization in the GOP, and the need to be independent from the government.In August 2013, Love was chosen by Newsmax as an "Up and Comer" in their list of top "25 Influential Women of the GOP," given her visible position as a young black female Republican. In November 2013, Love acknowledged the growing consensus that the Tea Party needed to shift away from being the "party of no," disagreeing with its part in forcing a federal government shutdown over the budget. She later reiterated her support for the philosophy of the Tea Party and many of its leaders, including Utah Sen. Mike Lee.On December 17, 2013, Matheson announced that he would not run for re-election. Love was ranked as the favored candidate due to her name recognition and characteristics of the district. In early October 2014, the National Journal listed Utah's 4th district as the number one most likely district to change hands in November.In early 2014 Love was made a member of the Republican National Committee's National Advisory Council on African-American outreach. On April 26, 2014 Love won the Republican nomination for the 4th congressional district at the Utah Republican Convention, with 78% of the vote at the convention.On election night, Democratic Party nominee Doug Owens led Love until late in the evening, when she pulled ahead and ultimately won by more than 7,000 votes. Reacting to her victory, Love took a shot at the media's perceived obsession with identity politics, joking to her supporters: "Many of the naysayers out there said that Utah would never elect a black, Republican, LDS woman to Congress. Not only did we do it, we were the first to do it."


=== 2016 ===

Love ran for re-election in 2016. She defeated Democrat Doug Owens in the general election with 54% of the vote, over 12 points ahead of her nearest challenger. David Scott, a Democratic Representative from Georgia, gave $1,000 to Love's campaign.


=== 2018 ===

Love is currently defending her seat against Democrat Ben McAdams. In June 2018, CNN stated that the race was considered "consequential to both parties" because Love has "stood up to [President Donald Trump] on immigration" and "because national Democrats see McAdams as one of their best chances to gain a foothold on red turf."According to political polling and reporting website FiveThirtyEight, Love's votes have aligned with Trump's positions 96% of the time, as of August 2018.As of  August 2018, RealClearPolitics ranks the race as a "toss up". A poll performed in June 2018 shows McAdams within 6 percentage points of Love, within the poll's margin of error. As of July 2017, Love's and McAdams' campaigns have approximately equal levels of cash on hand.


== U.S. House of Representatives ==

With the start of the new Congress, Love was appointed to the House Financial Services Committee.
Love joined the Congressional Black Caucus in January 2015 after taking her seat. While campaigning in 2012, Love had said that if elected, she would "join the Congressional Black Caucus and try to take that thing apart from the inside out." She described the mainly Democratic Caucus as characterized by "demagoguery. They sit there and ignite emotions and ignite racism when there isn't. They use their positions to instill fear. Hope and change is turned into fear and blame. Fear that everybody is going to lose everything and blaming Congress for everything instead of taking responsibility." She later acknowledged the bonds created with fellow caucus members. "As the only female Republican member of the Congressional Black Caucus, I have the opportunity every day to work across the aisle on issues that are divisive but important," she said. "My faith and my belief in the humanity of every one of God's children helps me to work with my Congressional Black Caucus colleagues on important issues like criminal justice reform."In May 2015, she was a lead sponsor along with Duncan D. Hunter of HR 2518 the Student Right to Know Before You Go Act, designed to increase the amount of information universities and colleges are required to provide prospective students.In October 2015, Love was named to serve on the Select Investigative Panel on Planned Parenthood.In April 2016, Love got her first bill through the U.S. House. HR3791, which was approved in a 247–171 vote, raises limits on how large community banks can grow, which Love says will make more credit available.In December 2017, Love introduced the Stop Taxpayers Obligations to Perpetrators of Sexual Harassment Act. Passed by the U.S. House in February 2018, the bill would prevent members of Congress from settling sexual harassment claims with taxpayer money.In March 2018, Love became a supporter of creating federal laws against pyramid schemes. She also supported adding multi-vitamins to the list of items that could be purchased with food stamps.Love has been among those who have called on the Department of Education to not block state regulation of student loan providers.In May 2018 a defense bill included language that was co-authored by Love along with two other congresswomen that required the military to begin an investigation into the effects of military policies of doing in-depth investigations against service members who bring charges of sexual assault.Also in the spring of 2018 Love signed a discharge petition seeking to force a floor vote in the US House on a bills to change immigration legislation to do such things as grant regular status to people who came to the US without authorization when they were minors. This time period actually saw Love advocating on several fronts in relation to immigration. She also was the co-leader with Pramila Jayapal of an effort to keep in place rules that allowed accompanying spouses of H-4 Visa holders to have work authorization while in the United States.In May 2018 The Small Bank Holding Company Relief Act that Love had authored was passed into law.Love is a member of the Congressional Western Caucus and the Climate Solutions Caucus.


== Political positions ==
 Love says she favors "fiscal discipline, limited government, and personal responsibility." She has also said that she asks herself three questions whenever she approaches an issue: "Is it affordable? Is it sustainable? Is it my job?"


=== Abortion ===
Love opposes abortion. In a speech at the 2017 March for Life, she said her parents, immigrants from Haiti, considered aborting her but decided not to do so.In her 2012 congressional campaign, Love proposed deep cuts to educational spending by eliminating or reducing funding for public education, free school lunches for the poor, special education funding, college grants, and subsidized school loans.


=== Environment ===
Love has a 2% lifetime score from the League of Conservation Voters. In 2012, Love said she would focus on opposing federal regulations, particularly those set by the Environmental Protection Agency. She supports the building of the Keystone XL pipeline. In 2014, she said she opposed the federal regulation of greenhouse gas emissions. More recently, however, she has become a member of the Climate Solutions Caucus and has said that climate policies and economic growth are not mutually exclusive. Love supports Utah's effort to reclaim public land from federal agency controls.Love's entrée into politics occurred after she and her husband bought a house on a lake in Utah that had a growing midge population. Love says that at the urging of her neighbors, she complained to the developer of the land and prompted a regular pesticide treatment. Stephanie Mencimer of Mother Jones wrote that "rather than focus her political activism on cleaning up the lake, or the environment more generally, she just wanted to kill the bugs and move on.


=== Economic and budget issues ===
In her 2012 campaign, Love proposed dramatically reducing food entitlement spending like free school lunches and food assistance to pregnant mothers and the poor. She defended these proposed cuts by saying people who are poor will become dependent if they don't work for their food.Love proposed a blueprint that would cut federal spending by $750 billion, with a focus on cutting entitlements like free school lunch, special education funding, subsidized school loans, funds aimed at preventing homelessness, healthcare subsidies, Medicaid spending, and food assistance. She has said her proposed cuts are a "nasty-tasting medicine" needed for the country to run properly.Love believes that the federal government should have less power.  Love was described as a Tea Party conservative in 2012. In a 2015 article titled "How 'tea party' is Mia Love?", the Washington Post wrote that "Love's rhetoric from 2012 to 2014 changed a bit, even as her policy positions remained fairly constant" and noted that Love had "angered some conservatives when she questioned the tea party driven government shutdown in 2013 over Obamacare." A blogger for libertarian-leaning magazine Reason described her as a "Trojan horse libertarian" due to her stance on homeschooling, federal control of land, and other issues.She also supports cutting taxes. She supported cuts to foreign aid and tort reform. In 2014, Love focused more on balancing the budget, avoiding stating specific cuts needed but identifying the goal of matching spending to revenue.

She has promoted the work of the libertarian Cato Institute.She would like to cut the Earned Income Tax Credit in half, and privatize the air traffic control system.

For the 2016 election season, Love received about $63,000 in donations from gun lobbyists and was endorsed by the National Rifle Association.In the wake of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, Love said she would support raising the minimum age to purchase semiautomatic rifles such as an AR-15 style rifle to age 21. She also stated that she was in favor of banning bump stocks and increasing the level of background checks needed to buy guns.

She also supported adding multi-vitamins to the list of items that could be purchased with food stamps.Love has been among those who have called on the Department of Education to not block state regulation of student loan providers.In May 2018 a defense bill included language that was co-authored by Love along with two other congresswomen that required the military to begin an investigation into the effects of military policies of doing in-depth investigations against service members who bring charges of sexual assault.Also in the spring of 2018 Love signed a discharge petition seeking to force a floor vote in the US House on a bills to change immigration legislation to do such things as grant regular status to people who came to the US without authorization when they were minors. This time period actually saw Love advocating on several fronts in relation to immigration.

Mia Love Haitian Embassy, Pearls of Excellence ExhibitLudmya "Mia" Love (née Bourdeau; December 6, 1975) is an American politician serving as the U.S. Representative for Utah's 4th congressional district since 2015. A Haitian American, Love is the first black female Republican elected to Congress and the first Haitian American elected to Congress from the state of Utah.Born to Haitian parents in the New York City borough of Brooklyn, Love was elected mayor of Saratoga Springs, Utah in 2010. She was previously on its city council. In 2012, Love ran for Utah's 4th congressional district, losing narrowly to incumbent Democratic Party U.S. Representative Jim Matheson. She was a speaker at the 2012 Republican National Convention. She was elected as a Republican to the House of Representatives on November 4, 2014, defeating Democratic opponent Doug Owens; she also defeated him again in a 2016 rematch to win her second term. She is currently defending her seat against Salt Lake County Mayor Ben McAdams in the 2018 midterm elections, in a race rated by RealClearPolitics as a toss-up as of September 2018.


== Early life and education ==
Love was born Ludmya Bourdeau on December 6, 1975, in the New York City borough of Brooklyn, the daughter of Mary and Jean Maxine Bourdeau. At a time of political repression, her parents emigrated together from Haiti in 1973, leaving their two older children behind with family. Her father had been threatened by the Tonton Macoute, the secret police in Haiti, and her parents traveled to the United States on a tourist visa. They spoke only French when they arrived. Her father became a paint-company manager and her mother worked as a nurse.Love's birth enabled her parents to gain a U.S. residency permit (green card) under an immigration law that favored immigrants from the Western Hemisphere who had a child born in the United States; it expired in early 1976.  They later became naturalized citizens.When Love was five, her family moved from Brooklyn to Norwalk, Connecticut. Love attended Norwalk High School. She was raised as a Roman Catholic in the faith of her parents. After the family settled in Norwalk, her parents brought her older siblings from Haiti to reunite the family.Love attended the University of Hartford Hartt School with a half-tuition scholarship. She graduated with a degree in musical theatre.After college, she worked at Sento Corporation and the Echopass Corporation. She was also a flight attendant with Continental Airlines. She moved to Utah in 1998 after converting to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and while working for Continental. There she married Jason Love.


== Early political career ==
Love began to be active in civic affairs when she served as the community spokesperson in Saratoga Springs, Utah in an effort to persuade the developer of her neighborhood to spray against flies. The city of 18,000 near Salt Lake City was established in 1997 and has had rapid growth.
In 2003 Love won a seat on the Saratoga Springs City Council. She was the first female Haitian-American elected official in Utah County; she took office in January 2004. During an economic downturn, as part of the city council Love approved a transition from the agriculture tax to municipal tax. She worked with other city council members to cut expenses, reducing the city's shortfall during the economic downturn from $3.5 million to $779,000. Saratoga Springs now has the highest possible bond rating for a city of its size.After six years on the Council, Love was elected mayor, winning with 861 votes to 594 for her opponent Jeff Francom. She served from January 2010 to January 2014. During her term, Love led the city in dealing with natural disasters, including a wildfire, followed shortly afterward by a severe mudslide.


== Elections ==


=== 2012 ===

Love ran in Utah's 4th congressional district, which was created after the 2010 Census. She competed for the Republican nomination against attorney Jay Cobb and State Reps. Stephen Sandstrom of Orem and Carl Wimmer of Herriman; she won the nomination on April 21, 2012, at the 2012 Utah Republican Party Convention with over 70 percent of the vote. She faced six-term Democratic incumbent Jim Matheson in the general election, who while living in the 2nd congressional district ran in the new 4th district, losing some of his reliably Democratic constituents.
Nationally, Love received campaign support from 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and his wife Ann Romney, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, House Budget Committee Chairman and 2012 Republican vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan, and Speaker of the House John Boehner.In 2012, National Journal named Love one of ten Republicans to follow on Twitter. When speaking to the 2012 Republican National Convention on August 28, 2012, she discussed lessons learned from her parents, immigrants from Haiti who fled political repression. She said, "Mr. President, I am here to tell you we are not buying what you are selling in 2012."In September 2012, questions arose about her parents' immigrant status. Forbes investigated a claim in an article that month in Mother Jones that no law existed in 1976 that would have allowed Love's parents to become citizens of the United States after her birth. Forbes found that immigrants who had been residents of the Western Hemisphere could get long-term residency permits (green cards) if they had a child born in the United States. Mother Jones issued a correction. In an October 2012 interview, her father said that Mia's birth as a U.S. citizen was key to him and his wife gaining permanent legal status and ultimately citizenship.Love lost the election to Jim Matheson by 768 votes out of 245,277 votes cast, a difference of 0.31%. She was regarded to have run a weak campaign, switching campaign managers three times, trying to "nationalize" the race rather than focus on local issues, and missing interviews and appointments because of rifts in her campaign staff.


=== 2014 ===

In March 2013, Love said she was seriously considering another run against Matheson. In May 2013 she announced she would run in 2014. As of  July 2013, Love had raised over $475,000 for her campaign. Love was an opening speaker at the 2013 Western Conservative Summit. She spoke of the need for increased grassroots organization in the GOP, and the need to be independent from the government.In August 2013, Love was chosen by Newsmax as an "Up and Comer" in their list of top "25 Influential Women of the GOP," given her visible position as a young black female Republican. In November 2013, Love acknowledged the growing consensus that the Tea Party needed to shift away from being the "party of no," disagreeing with its part in forcing a federal government shutdown over the budget. She later reiterated her support for the philosophy of the Tea Party and many of its leaders, including Utah Sen. Mike Lee.On December 17, 2013, Matheson announced that he would not run for re-election. Love was ranked as the favored candidate due to her name recognition and characteristics of the district. In early October 2014, the National Journal listed Utah's 4th district as the number one most likely district to change hands in November.In early 2014 Love was made a member of the Republican National Committee's National Advisory Council on African-American outreach. On April 26, 2014 Love won the Republican nomination for the 4th congressional district at the Utah Republican Convention, with 78% of the vote at the convention.On election night, Democratic Party nominee Doug Owens led Love until late in the evening, when she pulled ahead and ultimately won by more than 7,000 votes. Reacting to her victory, Love took a shot at the media's perceived obsession with identity politics, joking to her supporters: "Many of the naysayers out there said that Utah would never elect a black, Republican, LDS woman to Congress. Not only did we do it, we were the first to do it."


=== 2016 ===

Love ran for re-election in 2016. She defeated Democrat Doug Owens in the general election with 54% of the vote, over 12 points ahead of her nearest challenger. David Scott, a Democratic Representative from Georgia, gave $1,000 to Love's campaign.


=== 2018 ===

Love is currently defending her seat against Democrat Ben McAdams. In June 2018, CNN stated that the race was considered "consequential to both parties" because Love has "stood up to [President Donald Trump] on immigration" and "because national Democrats see McAdams as one of their best chances to gain a foothold on red turf."According to political polling and reporting website FiveThirtyEight, Love's votes have aligned with Trump's positions 96% of the time, as of August 2018.As of  August 2018, RealClearPolitics ranks the race as a "toss up". A poll performed in June 2018 shows McAdams within 6 percentage points of Love, within the poll's margin of error. As of July 2017, Love's and McAdams' campaigns have approximately equal levels of cash on hand.


== U.S. House of Representatives ==

With the start of the new Congress, Love was appointed to the House Financial Services Committee.
Love joined the Congressional Black Caucus in January 2015 after taking her seat. While campaigning in 2012, Love had said that if elected, she would "join the Congressional Black Caucus and try to take that thing apart from the inside out." She described the mainly Democratic Caucus as characterized by "demagoguery. They sit there and ignite emotions and ignite racism when there isn't. They use their positions to instill fear. Hope and change is turned into fear and blame. Fear that everybody is going to lose everything and blaming Congress for everything instead of taking responsibility." She later acknowledged the bonds created with fellow caucus members. "As the only female Republican member of the Congressional Black Caucus, I have the opportunity every day to work across the aisle on issues that are divisive but important," she said. "My faith and my belief in the humanity of every one of God's children helps me to work with my Congressional Black Caucus colleagues on important issues like criminal justice reform."In May 2015, she was a lead sponsor along with Duncan D. Hunter of HR 2518 the Student Right to Know Before You Go Act, designed to increase the amount of information universities and colleges are required to provide prospective students.In October 2015, Love was named to serve on the Select Investigative Panel on Planned Parenthood.In April 2016, Love got her first bill through the U.S. House.
