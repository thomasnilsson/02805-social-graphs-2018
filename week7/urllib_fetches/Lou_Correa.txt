He represented the First District, which includes the cities of Garden Grove, Santa Ana, and Westminster as well as unincorporated areas of the county including Midway City.

In yet another close race, Correa won the election with a margin of victory of 1,392 votes.  As of 2016, he is the last Democrat to serve on the Orange County Board of Supervisors.
