In May 2015, the National Republican Congressional Committee named Knight to its Patriot Program. The program gives added attention by the party to reelection campaigns in districts most likely to switch to Democratic representation in upcoming elections.In June 2016, analyst David Wasserman moved Knight's district into the "toss-up" category, due to the negative influence of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on down-ticket races and the growth in Democratic voter registration in the 25th Congressional District. In addition to Knight, two Democrats and one other Republican filed to run in the district's top-two primary, which took place on June 7, 2016.

He defeated Democrat Bryan Caforio with 54% of the vote.

== Political positions ==


=== Vote Smart Political Courage Test ===
According to Vote Smart's 2016 analysis, Knight generally supports pro-life legislation, opposes an income tax increase, supports federal spending as a means of promoting economic growth, supports lowering taxes as a means of promoting economic growth, opposes requiring states to adopt federal education standards, supports the building of the Keystone Pipeline, supports government funding for the development of renewable energy, opposes the federal regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, opposes gun-control legislation, supports repealing the Affordable Care Act, supports requiring immigrants who are unlawfully present to return to their country of origin before they are eligible for citizenship, and supports increased American intervention in Iraq and Syria beyond air support.


=== Second amendment ===
When Knight responded to the October 2017 Las Vegas massacre by writing online that his prayers were "with the victims and their families" and describing it as "an unfortunate reminder of the evil in our world," he was greeted with angry comments about his opposition to gun control. Peter Marston, a professor at Cal State Northridge stated it "was bad enough when there was no middle ground for people to talk about. Now we've reached the point where if you don't say what I believe, you've committed an affront to me."


=== Drug policy ===
Knight has a "C" rating from NORML regarding his voting record on cannabis-related matters. Knight says he has never smoked marijuana. He believes that cannabis should be removed as a Schedule I drug and be reclassified as a Schedule 3 drug, due to its medicinal use. Knight believes legalization should be up to individual states, yet it should remain illegal federally. 
He voted in favor, in 2016, for allowing veterans access to medical marijuana, if legal in their state, per their Veterans Health Administration doctor's recommendation.


=== Confederate flag ===
In 2014, Knight was one of three California legislators who voted against a measure barring the display or sale of Confederate flag images from California state museums and gift shops.


=== Military ===
Knight introduced H.R. 1162, the No Hero Left Untreated Act of 2017, which established a pilot program to implement emergent advanced technology to treat service members and veterans with PTSD and traumatic brain injuries.On May 24, 2018, the House of Representatives voted 351 - 66 to approve the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for 2019, which included the provisions of H.R. 5546, introduced in April by Knight to authorize the use of $20 million allocated to the National Guard's counterdrug programs to combat opioid trafficking and abuse. "The international illegal drug trade not only peddles poison into our communities, but is also a significant threat to national security." said Knight. "Terrorist organizations and international cartels often fund themselves through the trade of heroin, cocaine, and other illicit substances. By deploying already-existing DOD intelligence and surveillance assets to support ongoing anti-narcotics operations, we can give law enforcement agencies a huge advantage over criminals."The NDAA, passed by the House on May 24, 2018, also included the provisions of H.R. 5707, the Sexual Trauma Response and Treatment (START) Act, introduced by Knight in May. It would establish a pilot Department of Defense program to provide comprehensive outpatient programs to military service members with military sexual trauma.In April 2015, Knight voted to impose a one-year delay on new Department of Defense rules designed to shield military families from abusive terms on payday loans and other forms of expensive short-term credit.


=== Economy ===
In November 2017, Knight voted in favor of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, the house version of the Republican Party's tax reform bill. The House bill removes state and local tax breaks that many Californians use, such as the mortgage interest deduction. Several House Republicans representing Californian districts voted against the legislation because it raised taxes on Californians. Knight said after the vote that he hoped that a reconciliation version of the bill with the Senate would make the bill better: "I don't know if they're going to make it better, but we'll see. There are some things in the Senate bill I like, there are some things in there that I don't like."According to the Los Angeles Times, immediately after the vote, the Senate version of the bill "contains even deeper cuts to state and local tax breaks that are popular with Californians but maintains the mortgage interest deduction at its current level instead of cutting it in half as the House plan does. It also repeals Obamacare's individual mandate, a move that could further complicate the situation for California members who represent districts with a lot of Obamacare enrollees." In December 2017, Knight voted in favor of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.Knight stated that the new bill would "deliver tax relief to all Americans" and denied claims that the upper class would benefit more in the long-term than the middle- and lower-class. He said that the latter will get "a break on their personal taxes" and called the bill a step towards tax reform and a simplified tax code.


=== Environment ===
In September 2014, asked on a candidate questionnaire if he believed the scientific consensus on climate change, Knight wrote that California's efforts to curtail global warming were "rash," that  California's law the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (AB 32) was "killing California's economy", and that the federal government should not regulate greenhouse gas emissions.In February 2016, Knight introduced a bill that would block mining at Soledad Canyon. Knight also introduced legislation intended to increase federal regulation of gas storage facilities and prevent natural gas leaks. Knight's legislation was merged into a bipartisan bill named the Protecting our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act of 2016. In April 2016, the bill was passed unanimously by the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. In June 2016, Knight's bill was signed into law by President Obama.The League of Conservation Voters has given Knight a lifetime score of 0%.`

On May 4, 2017, Knight voted to repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) and pass the American Health Care Act.Knight highlighted how he contributed to an amendment to the bill that would provide $8 billion in funding over five years to help insure those with preexisting conditions in so-called "high-risk pools".


=== Immigration ===
In May 2016, Knight participated in a public debate with his Democratic challengers. In it he said that immigration reform should focus on those who want to move to the U.S. legally.


=== Israel ===
In May 2018 Knight was a member of the ten-person House delegation that attended the opening of the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem. "It was an honor to be a part of this delegation and show support for our Israeli friends," said Knight. "Israel is our longest and closest ally in the region and still stands as the only modern democracy in the area. We share the same goals for national security, human rights, and economic relations."


=== Social Security ===
In a debate with other candidates in May 2016, Knight called Social Security "a bad idea" and warned that the U.S. Social Security system retirement system will run out of money by 2030 if major changes are not implemented.


=== Aviation ===
In February 2016, Knight introduced legislation that would allow the Federal Aviation Administration to continue and expand upon its research, engineering and development programs through 2019.Knight introduced the Aeronautics Innovation Act of 2017.


=== LGBT rights ===
He voted against an amendment, which ultimately failed narrowly, that stated that religious corporations, associations and institutions that receive federal contracts can't be discriminated against on the basis of religion. Democrats warn that such a provision could potentially allow discrimination against the LGBT community in the name of religious freedom.


=== Scientific and technological development ===
On February 13, 2018, three Knight-authored bills were passed in the House intended to "advance cutting edge research initiatives and improve STEM education." H.R. 4376, The Department of Energy Research Infrastructure Act, would fund research in advanced photonics, x-ray energy applications, and other scientific fields. The other bills were H.R. 4254, The Women in Aerospace Education Act,  and H.R. 3397, The Building Blocks of STEM Act.

== Political positions ==


=== Vote Smart Political Courage Test ===
According to Vote Smart's 2016 analysis, Knight generally supports pro-life legislation, opposes an income tax increase, supports federal spending as a means of promoting economic growth, supports lowering taxes as a means of promoting economic growth, opposes requiring states to adopt federal education standards, supports the building of the Keystone Pipeline, supports government funding for the development of renewable energy, opposes the federal regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, opposes gun-control legislation, supports repealing the Affordable Care Act, supports requiring immigrants who are unlawfully present to return to their country of origin before they are eligible for citizenship, and supports increased American intervention in Iraq and Syria beyond air support.


=== Second amendment ===
When Knight responded to the October 2017 Las Vegas massacre by writing online that his prayers were "with the victims and their families" and describing it as "an unfortunate reminder of the evil in our world," he was greeted with angry comments about his opposition to gun control. Peter Marston, a professor at Cal State Northridge stated it "was bad enough when there was no middle ground for people to talk about. Now we've reached the point where if you don't say what I believe, you've committed an affront to me."


=== Drug policy ===
Knight has a "C" rating from NORML regarding his voting record on cannabis-related matters. Knight says he has never smoked marijuana. He believes that cannabis should be removed as a Schedule I drug and be reclassified as a Schedule 3 drug, due to its medicinal use. Knight believes legalization should be up to individual states, yet it should remain illegal federally. 
He voted in favor, in 2016, for allowing veterans access to medical marijuana, if legal in their state, per their Veterans Health Administration doctor's recommendation.


=== Confederate flag ===
In 2014, Knight was one of three California legislators who voted against a measure barring the display or sale of Confederate flag images from California state museums and gift shops.


=== Military ===
Knight introduced H.R. 1162, the No Hero Left Untreated Act of 2017, which established a pilot program to implement emergent advanced technology to treat service members and veterans with PTSD and traumatic brain injuries.On May 24, 2018, the House of Representatives voted 351 - 66 to approve the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for 2019, which included the provisions of H.R. 5546, introduced in April by Knight to authorize the use of $20 million allocated to the National Guard's counterdrug programs to combat opioid trafficking and abuse. "The international illegal drug trade not only peddles poison into our communities, but is also a significant threat to national security." said Knight. "Terrorist organizations and international cartels often fund themselves through the trade of heroin, cocaine, and other illicit substances. By deploying already-existing DOD intelligence and surveillance assets to support ongoing anti-narcotics operations, we can give law enforcement agencies a huge advantage over criminals."The NDAA, passed by the House on May 24, 2018, also included the provisions of H.R. 5707, the Sexual Trauma Response and Treatment (START) Act, introduced by Knight in May. It would establish a pilot Department of Defense program to provide comprehensive outpatient programs to military service members with military sexual trauma.In April 2015, Knight voted to impose a one-year delay on new Department of Defense rules designed to shield military families from abusive terms on payday loans and other forms of expensive short-term credit.

The House bill removes state and local tax breaks that many Californians use, such as the mortgage interest deduction. Several House Republicans representing Californian districts voted against the legislation because it raised taxes on Californians. Knight said after the vote that he hoped that a reconciliation version of the bill with the Senate would make the bill better: "I don't know if they're going to make it better, but we'll see. There are some things in the Senate bill I like, there are some things in there that I don't like."According to the Los Angeles Times, immediately after the vote, the Senate version of the bill "contains even deeper cuts to state and local tax breaks that are popular with Californians but maintains the mortgage interest deduction at its current level instead of cutting it in half as the House plan does. It also repeals Obamacare's individual mandate, a move that could further complicate the situation for California members who represent districts with a lot of Obamacare enrollees." In December 2017, Knight voted in favor of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.Knight stated that the new bill would "deliver tax relief to all Americans" and denied claims that the upper class would benefit more in the long-term than the middle- and lower-class. He said that the latter will get "a break on their personal taxes" and called the bill a step towards tax reform and a simplified tax code.


=== Environment ===
In September 2014, asked on a candidate questionnaire if he believed the scientific consensus on climate change, Knight wrote that California's efforts to curtail global warming were "rash," that  California's law the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (AB 32) was "killing California's economy", and that the federal government should not regulate greenhouse gas emissions.In February 2016, Knight introduced a bill that would block mining at Soledad Canyon. Knight also introduced legislation intended to increase federal regulation of gas storage facilities and prevent natural gas leaks. Knight's legislation was merged into a bipartisan bill named the Protecting our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act of 2016. In April 2016, the bill was passed unanimously by the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. In June 2016, Knight's bill was signed into law by President Obama.The League of Conservation Voters has given Knight a lifetime score of 0%.`

=== Immigration ===
In May 2016, Knight participated in a public debate with his Democratic challengers. In it he said that immigration reform should focus on those who want to move to the U.S. legally.


=== Israel ===
In May 2018 Knight was a member of the ten-person House delegation that attended the opening of the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem. "It was an honor to be a part of this delegation and show support for our Israeli friends," said Knight. "Israel is our longest and closest ally in the region and still stands as the only modern democracy in the area. We share the same goals for national security, human rights, and economic relations."


=== Social Security ===
In a debate with other candidates in May 2016, Knight called Social Security "a bad idea" and warned that the U.S. Social Security system retirement system will run out of money by 2030 if major changes are not implemented.


=== Aviation ===
In February 2016, Knight introduced legislation that would allow the Federal Aviation Administration to continue and expand upon its research, engineering and development programs through 2019.Knight introduced the Aeronautics Innovation Act of 2017.


=== LGBT rights ===
He voted against an amendment, which ultimately failed narrowly, that stated that religious corporations, associations and institutions that receive federal contracts can't be discriminated against on the basis of religion. Democrats warn that such a provision could potentially allow discrimination against the LGBT community in the name of religious freedom.


=== Scientific and technological development ===
On February 13, 2018, three Knight-authored bills were passed in the House intended to "advance cutting edge research initiatives and improve STEM education." H.R. 4376, The Department of Energy Research Infrastructure Act, would fund research in advanced photonics, x-ray energy applications, and other scientific fields.

The program gives added attention by the party to reelection campaigns in districts most likely to switch to Democratic representation in upcoming elections.In June 2016, analyst David Wasserman moved Knight's district into the "toss-up" category, due to the negative influence of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on down-ticket races and the growth in Democratic voter registration in the 25th Congressional District.

=== Second amendment ===
When Knight responded to the October 2017 Las Vegas massacre by writing online that his prayers were "with the victims and their families" and describing it as "an unfortunate reminder of the evil in our world," he was greeted with angry comments about his opposition to gun control. Peter Marston, a professor at Cal State Northridge stated it "was bad enough when there was no middle ground for people to talk about. Now we've reached the point where if you don't say what I believe, you've committed an affront to me."


=== Drug policy ===
Knight has a "C" rating from NORML regarding his voting record on cannabis-related matters. Knight says he has never smoked marijuana. He believes that cannabis should be removed as a Schedule I drug and be reclassified as a Schedule 3 drug, due to its medicinal use. Knight believes legalization should be up to individual states, yet it should remain illegal federally. 
He voted in favor, in 2016, for allowing veterans access to medical marijuana, if legal in their state, per their Veterans Health Administration doctor's recommendation.


=== Confederate flag ===
In 2014, Knight was one of three California legislators who voted against a measure barring the display or sale of Confederate flag images from California state museums and gift shops.


=== Military ===
Knight introduced H.R. 1162, the No Hero Left Untreated Act of 2017, which established a pilot program to implement emergent advanced technology to treat service members and veterans with PTSD and traumatic brain injuries.On May 24, 2018, the House of Representatives voted 351 - 66 to approve the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for 2019, which included the provisions of H.R. 5546, introduced in April by Knight to authorize the use of $20 million allocated to the National Guard's counterdrug programs to combat opioid trafficking and abuse. "The international illegal drug trade not only peddles poison into our communities, but is also a significant threat to national security." said Knight. "Terrorist organizations and international cartels often fund themselves through the trade of heroin, cocaine, and other illicit substances. By deploying already-existing DOD intelligence and surveillance assets to support ongoing anti-narcotics operations, we can give law enforcement agencies a huge advantage over criminals."The NDAA, passed by the House on May 24, 2018, also included the provisions of H.R. 5707, the Sexual Trauma Response and Treatment (START) Act, introduced by Knight in May. It would establish a pilot Department of Defense program to provide comprehensive outpatient programs to military service members with military sexual trauma.In April 2015, Knight voted to impose a one-year delay on new Department of Defense rules designed to shield military families from abusive terms on payday loans and other forms of expensive short-term credit.


=== Economy ===
In November 2017, Knight voted in favor of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, the house version of the Republican Party's tax reform bill. The House bill removes state and local tax breaks that many Californians use, such as the mortgage interest deduction. Several House Republicans representing Californian districts voted against the legislation because it raised taxes on Californians. Knight said after the vote that he hoped that a reconciliation version of the bill with the Senate would make the bill better: "I don't know if they're going to make it better, but we'll see. There are some things in the Senate bill I like, there are some things in there that I don't like."According to the Los Angeles Times, immediately after the vote, the Senate version of the bill "contains even deeper cuts to state and local tax breaks that are popular with Californians but maintains the mortgage interest deduction at its current level instead of cutting it in half as the House plan does. It also repeals Obamacare's individual mandate, a move that could further complicate the situation for California members who represent districts with a lot of Obamacare enrollees." In December 2017, Knight voted in favor of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.Knight stated that the new bill would "deliver tax relief to all Americans" and denied claims that the upper class would benefit more in the long-term than the middle- and lower-class. He said that the latter will get "a break on their personal taxes" and called the bill a step towards tax reform and a simplified tax code.


=== Environment ===
In September 2014, asked on a candidate questionnaire if he believed the scientific consensus on climate change, Knight wrote that California's efforts to curtail global warming were "rash," that  California's law the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (AB 32) was "killing California's economy", and that the federal government should not regulate greenhouse gas emissions.In February 2016, Knight introduced a bill that would block mining at Soledad Canyon. Knight also introduced legislation intended to increase federal regulation of gas storage facilities and prevent natural gas leaks. Knight's legislation was merged into a bipartisan bill named the Protecting our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act of 2016.

"It was an honor to be a part of this delegation and show support for our Israeli friends," said Knight. "Israel is our longest and closest ally in the region and still stands as the only modern democracy in the area. We share the same goals for national security, human rights, and economic relations."
