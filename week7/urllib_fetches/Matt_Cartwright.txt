=== Elections ===
2012
Pennsylvania Republicans, who controlled the redistricting process after the 2010 United States Census, significantly altered Holden's 17th district. The old 17th had been based in Harrisburg, but the new 17th had been pushed well to the north and east. In the process, it absorbed heavily Democratic Scranton and Wilkes-Barre, previously in the 11th District. The remap significantly altered the 17th's demographics. The old 17th had been anchored in traditionally Republican territory in central Pennsylvania; in much of the district, Holden was the only elected Democrat above the county level. John McCain carried it with 51 percent of the vote. In contrast, the new 17th was anchored in northeastern Pennsylvania, which had long been the most Democratic region of the state outside of Philadelphia and Pittsburgh.  Had the district existed in 2008, Barack Obama would have carried it with 56 percent of the vote.
It was widely believed that Holden, a member of the Blue Dog Coalition, would face a tough fight to secure re-election in the primary. Not only was the district significantly bluer than its predecessor, but it was located in territory that he did not know and did not know him. The only portion of the district that had been in the old 17th was Holden's home in Schuylkill County, with the majority of Democratic primary voters located in counties considered more favorable to Cartwright's candidacy. During the primary, Cartwright described himself as being from "the Democratic wing of the Democratic Party" — a line often employed by Howard Dean and Paul Wellstone. He was supported by MoveOn.org, the League of Conservation Voters, and the Campaign for Primary Accountability. Cartwright ran as a self-professed "FDR Democrat", and as an ally of President Obama on taxes and health care reform, and pledged to work with U.S. Senator Robert P. Casey, Jr., also of Scranton, on regulations for safety in fracking. Cartwright also benefited in the race from endorsements from popular local public figures like State Representative Phyllis Mundy and former Scranton mayor Jimmy Connors.
Holden's opposition to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and his support of energy legislation that included the Halliburton loophole are believed to have contributed to his defeat.On April 24, 2012, Cartwright defeated Holden by 57%-43% in the primary.In the November general election, Cartwright faced Republican nurse Laureen Cummings, a leader of the Scranton Tea Party. On November 6, Cartwright defeated Cummings, 61%–39% to become the district's next congressman.On January 4, 2013, Cartwright was selected by his peers to serve as a class president of the 49 new Democratic members of the 113th Congress.On March 28, 2014, Cartwright was named a "moderate Democratic leader" in the U.S. House by the independent legislative watchdog GovTrack.us.
2014On November 4, 2014, Cartwright won a second term, defeating Republican challenger David Moylan, M.D., the elected Coroner of Schuylkill County, PA by 13.6 points.
2016On November 8, 2016, Cartwright won his third term, defeating Republican challenger Matthew Connolly, a businessman from Northampton County, PA by seven points.2018
Donald Trump won the 17th district while Cartwright won re-election by his lowest margin (7 points). The DCCC has included Cartwright on their "frontline" list. The NRCC has included Cartwright on their target list as well. Despite this, the district is rated as Likely D, meaning it is expected that Cartwright will win re-election.On September 5, 2018, the National Republican Congressional Committee released its first attack TV ad against Cartwright. The ad focuses on Cartwright being late in paying taxes, while painting him side-by-side with Minority Leader, Rep. Nancy Pelosi in wanting to raise taxes.

In September 2018, Cartwright introduced a bill called the Coal Royalty Fairness and Communities Investment Act of 2018. The legislation would give $70 million to struggling historic coal communities for the purpose of building their local economies and promotion job opportunities. The bill would also ensure fair returns on publicly-owned coal and increase the transparency of the federal coal program. Of the funding the bill would provide, $5 million would go toward funding the construction and operation of projects that would capture and store carbon dioxide emissions from industrial sources.


=== Healthcare ===
Ed O'Keefe of the Washington Post wrote on November 3, 2013, that Cartwright was elected largely based on the Affordable Care Act "because the veteran moderate Democrat he challenged in a primary voted against it." According to O'Keefe, "Cartwright spent his first year in office preparing constituents for 'the ACA'."In May 2017, Cartwright voted against the Republican-sponsored American Health Care Act. Cartwright said in January 2018 that he continued to support the Affordable Care Act.

Although he believes American energy production and American economic growth are linked, he does not believe environment-friendly methods should be ruled out. He supports investments in sustainable "green" energy productions with fewer emissions. He also supports further forest conservation and is committed to keep water sources clean through repealing legislation allowing companies to pollute water supplies.On February 26, 2014, Cartwright introduced the Streamlining Energy Efficiency for Schools Act of 2014 (H.R. 4092; 113th Congress), a bill that would require the United States Department of Energy to establish a centralized clearinghouse to disseminate information on federal programs, incentives, and mechanisms for financing energy-efficient retrofits and upgrades at schools. Cartwright argued that "the bill is a strategic and cost-saving investment to relieve the fiscal pressure felt by schools across the country while bringing us closer to energy security."

2012
Pennsylvania Republicans, who controlled the redistricting process after the 2010 United States Census, significantly altered Holden's 17th district. The old 17th had been based in Harrisburg, but the new 17th had been pushed well to the north and east. In the process, it absorbed heavily Democratic Scranton and Wilkes-Barre, previously in the 11th District. The remap significantly altered the 17th's demographics. The old 17th had been anchored in traditionally Republican territory in central Pennsylvania; in much of the district, Holden was the only elected Democrat above the county level. John McCain carried it with 51 percent of the vote. In contrast, the new 17th was anchored in northeastern Pennsylvania, which had long been the most Democratic region of the state outside of Philadelphia and Pittsburgh.  Had the district existed in 2008, Barack Obama would have carried it with 56 percent of the vote.
It was widely believed that Holden, a member of the Blue Dog Coalition, would face a tough fight to secure re-election in the primary. Not only was the district significantly bluer than its predecessor, but it was located in territory that he did not know and did not know him. The only portion of the district that had been in the old 17th was Holden's home in Schuylkill County, with the majority of Democratic primary voters located in counties considered more favorable to Cartwright's candidacy. During the primary, Cartwright described himself as being from "the Democratic wing of the Democratic Party" — a line often employed by Howard Dean and Paul Wellstone. He was supported by MoveOn.org, the League of Conservation Voters, and the Campaign for Primary Accountability. Cartwright ran as a self-professed "FDR Democrat", and as an ally of President Obama on taxes and health care reform, and pledged to work with U.S. Senator Robert P. Casey, Jr., also of Scranton, on regulations for safety in fracking. Cartwright also benefited in the race from endorsements from popular local public figures like State Representative Phyllis Mundy and former Scranton mayor Jimmy Connors.
Holden's opposition to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and his support of energy legislation that included the Halliburton loophole are believed to have contributed to his defeat.On April 24, 2012, Cartwright defeated Holden by 57%-43% in the primary.In the November general election, Cartwright faced Republican nurse Laureen Cummings, a leader of the Scranton Tea Party. On November 6, Cartwright defeated Cummings, 61%–39% to become the district's next congressman.On January 4, 2013, Cartwright was selected by his peers to serve as a class president of the 49 new Democratic members of the 113th Congress.On March 28, 2014, Cartwright was named a "moderate Democratic leader" in the U.S. House by the independent legislative watchdog GovTrack.us.
2014On November 4, 2014, Cartwright won a second term, defeating Republican challenger David Moylan, M.D., the elected Coroner of Schuylkill County, PA by 13.6 points.
2016On November 8, 2016, Cartwright won his third term, defeating Republican challenger Matthew Connolly, a businessman from Northampton County, PA by seven points.2018
Donald Trump won the 17th district while Cartwright won re-election by his lowest margin (7 points). The DCCC has included Cartwright on their "frontline" list. The NRCC has included Cartwright on their target list as well. Despite this, the district is rated as Likely D, meaning it is expected that Cartwright will win re-election.On September 5, 2018, the National Republican Congressional Committee released its first attack TV ad against Cartwright. The ad focuses on Cartwright being late in paying taxes, while painting him side-by-side with Minority Leader, Rep. Nancy Pelosi in wanting to raise taxes.

In September 2018, Cartwright introduced a bill called the Coal Royalty Fairness and Communities Investment Act of 2018. The legislation would give $70 million to struggling historic coal communities for the purpose of building their local economies and promotion job opportunities. The bill would also ensure fair returns on publicly-owned coal and increase the transparency of the federal coal program. Of the funding the bill would provide, $5 million would go toward funding the construction and operation of projects that would capture and store carbon dioxide emissions from industrial sources.


=== Healthcare ===
Ed O'Keefe of the Washington Post wrote on November 3, 2013, that Cartwright was elected largely based on the Affordable Care Act "because the veteran moderate Democrat he challenged in a primary voted against it." According to O'Keefe, "Cartwright spent his first year in office preparing constituents for 'the ACA'."In May 2017, Cartwright voted against the Republican-sponsored American Health Care Act. Cartwright said in January 2018 that he continued to support the Affordable Care Act.

He describes the middle class as being "under assault" and seeks to alter the tax system to allow the middle-class to carry less of a burden.Cartwright has criticized the Trump tax cut, saying that it gave taxpayers little relief while adding huge sums to the national debt.Cartwright has stated that promoting family-sustaining jobs is his "No. 1 message." He introduced H.R. 2296, the Job Creation through Energy Efficiency Manufacturing Act, and H.R. 5812, the Innovate America Act.He supports stricter enforcement of prohibitions against gender based discrimination in wages. He has described education as the only method of truly alleviating poverty.Cartwright supports reducing defense spending.


=== Environment ===
To combat global warming, Cartwright supports implementing cap-and-trade emission standards for companies to encourage lowering emissions. Although he believes American energy production and American economic growth are linked, he does not believe environment-friendly methods should be ruled out.
